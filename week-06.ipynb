    "The training model appears to be taking random samples, but in a sample so small, it is easier for certain authors to be under or overrepresented in the training and/or test data. This keeps leading to errors where the model does not have enough training data on some authors to accurately attribute the correct plays to them. There are also issues where, due to the test data being skewed so heavily towards one author, it's not always clear how accurately it can assess the others. For example, in one of the tests, Sophocles comprmised 10/13 of the test plays. "

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The gods I ask deliverance from these labours, Watch of a year’s length whereby, slumbering through it On the Atreidai’s roofs on elbow, — dog-like — I know of nightly star-groups the assemblage, And those that bring to men winter and summer Bright dynasts, as they pride them in the aether — Stars, when they wither, and the uprisings of them. And now on ward I wait the torch’s token, The glow of fire, shall bring from And word of capture: so prevails audacious The man’s-way-planning hoping heart of woman. But when I, driven from night-rest, dew-drenched hold to This couch of mine — not looked upon by visions, Since fear instead of sleep still stands beside me, So as that fast I fix in sleep no eyelids — And when to sing or chirp a tune I fancy, For slumber such song-remedy infusing, I wail then, for this House’s fortune groaning, Not, as of old, after the best ways governed. Now, lucky be deliverance from these labours, At good news — the appearing dusky fire! O hail, thou lamp of night, a day-long lightness Revealing, and of dances the ordainment! Halloo, halloo! To Agamemnon’s wife I show, by shouting, That, from bed starting up at once, i’ the household Joyous acclaim, good-omened to this torch-blaze, She send aloft, if haply Be taken, as the beacon boasts announcing. Ay, and, for me, myself will dance a prelude, For, that my masters’ dice drop right, I’ll reckon: Since thrice-six has it thrown to me, this signal. Well, may it hap that, as he comes, the loved hand O’ the household’s lord I may sustain with this hand! As for the rest, I’m mute: on tongue a big ox Has trodden. Yet this House, if voice it take should, Most plain would speak. So, willing I myself speak To those who know: to who know not — I’m blankness. The tenth year this, since Priamos’ great match, King Menelaos, Agamemnon King, — The strenuous yoke-pair of the Atreidai’s honour Two-throned, two-sceptred, whereof Zeus was donor — Did from this land the aid, the armament despatch, The thousand-sailored force of Argives clamouring Passion forth vultures which, because of grief Away, — as are their young ones, — with the thief, Lofty above their brood-nests wheel in ring, Row round and round with oar of either wing, Lament the bedded chicks, lost labour that was love: Which hearing, one above — Whether Apollon, Pan or Zeus — that wail, Sharp-piercing bird-shriek of the guests who fare Housemates with gods in air — Suchanone sends, against who these assail, What, late-sent, shall not fail Of punishing — Erinus. Here as there, The Guardian of the Guest, Zeus, the excelling one, Sends against Alexandros either son Of Atreus: for that wife, the many-husbanded, Appointing many a tug that tries the limb, While the knee plays the prop in dust, while, shred To morsels, lies the spear-shaft; in those grim Marriage-prolusions when their Fury wed Danaoi and Troes, both alike. All’s said: Things are where things are, and, as fate has willed, So shall they be fulfilled. Not gently-grieving, not just doling out The drops of expiation — no, nor tears distilled — Shall he we know of bring the hard about To soft — that intense ire At those mock rites unsanctified by fire. But we pay nought here: through our flesh, age-weighed, Left out from who gave aid In that day, — we remain, Staying on staves a strength The equal of a child’s at length. For when young marrow in the breast doth reign, That’s the old man’s match, — Ares out of place In either: but in oldest age’s case, Foliage a-fading, why, he wends his way On three feet, and, no stronger than a child, Wanders about gone wild, A dream in day. Empowered am I to sing The omens, what their force which, journeying, Rejoiced the potentates: (For still, from God, inflates My breast song-suasion: age, Born to the business, still such war can wage) — How the fierce bird against the Teukris land Despatched, with spear and executing hand, The Achaian’s two-throned empery—o’er Two rulers with one mind: The birds’ king to these kings of ships, on high, — The black sort, and the sort that’s white behind,  — Appearing by the palace, on the spear-throw side, In right sky-regions, visible far and wide, — Devouring a hare-creature, great with young, Baulked of more racings they, as she from whom they sprung! Ah, Linos, say — ah, Linos, song of wail! But may the good prevail! I am come, reverencing power in thee, O Klutaimnestra! For ’t is just we bow To the ruler’s wife, — the male-seat man-bereaved. But if thou, having heard good news, — or none, — For good news’ hope dost sacrifice thus wide, I would hear gladly: art thou mute, — no grudge! Good-news-announcer, may — as is the by-word — Morn become, truly, — news from Night his mother! But thou shalt learn joy past all hope of hearing. Priamos’ city have the Argeioi taken. How sayest? The word, from want of faith, escaped me.  Joy overcreeps me, calling forth the tear-drop. Right! for, that glad thou art, thine eye convicts thee. For — what to thee, of all this, trusty token? What’s here! how else? unless the god have cheated. Haply thou flattering shows of dreams respectest? No fancy would I take of soul sleep-burthened. But has there Puffed thee up some unwinged omen? As a young maid’s my mind thou mockest grossly. Well, at what time was — even sacked, the city? Of this same mother Night — the dawn, I tell thee. And who of messengers could reach this swiftness? Hephaistos — sending a bright blaze from Ide. Beacon did beacon send, from fire the poster, Hitherward: Ide to the rock Hermaian Of Zeus’ seat received in turn, the Athoan summit. And, — so upsoaring as to stride sea over, The strong lamp-voyager, and all for joyance — Did the gold-glorious splendour, any sun like, Pass on — the pine-tree — to Makistos’ watch-place; Who did not, — tardy, — caught, no wits about him, By sleep, — decline his portion of the missive. And far the beacon’s light, on stream Euripos Arriving, made aware Messapios’ warders, And up they lit in turn, played herald onwards, Kindling with flame a heap of grey old heather. And, strengthening still, the lamp, decaying nowise, Springing o’er Plain Asopos, — full-moon-fashion Effulgent, — toward the crag of Mount Kithairon, Roused a new rendering-up of fire the escort — And light, far escort, lacked no recognition O’ the guard — as burning more than burnings told you. And over Lake Gorgopis light went leaping, And, at Mount Aigiplanktos safe arriving, Enforced the law — And they send, lighting up with ungrudged vigour, Of flame a huge beard, ay, the very foreland So as to strike above, in burning onward, The look-out which commands the Strait Saronic. Then did it dart until it reached the outpost Mount Arachnaios here, the city’s neighbour; And then darts to this roof of the Atreidai This light of Ide’s fire not unforefathered! Such are the rules prescribed the flambeau-bearers: He beats that’s first and also last in running. Such is the proof and token I declare thee, My husband having sent me news from The gods, indeed, anon will I pray, woman! But now, these words to hear, and sate my wonder Thoroughly, I am fain — if twice thou tell them.  I think a noise — no mixture — reigns i’ the city. Sour wine and unguent pour thou in one vessel — Standers-apart, not lovers, wouldst thou style them: And so, of captives and of conquerors, partwise The voices are to hear, of fortune diverse. For those, indeed, upon the bodies prostrate Of husbands, brothers, children upon parents — The old men, from a throat that ’s free no longer, Shriekingly wail the death-doom of their dearest: While these — the after-battle hungry labour, Which prompts night-faring, marshals them to breakfast On the town’s store, according to no billet Of sharing, but as each drew lot of fortune. In the spear-captured Troic habitations House they already: from the frosts upmethral And dews delivered, will they, luckless creatures, Without a watch to keep, slumber all night through. And if they fear the gods, the city-guarders, And the gods’ structures of the conquered country, They may not — capturers—soon in turn be captive. But see no prior lust befall the army To sack things sacred — by gain-cravings vanquished For there needs homeward the return’s salvation, To round the new limb back o’ the double race-course. And guilty to the gods if came the army, Awakened up the sorrow of those slaughtered Might be — should no outbursting evils happen. But may good beat — no turn to see i’ the balance! For, many benefits I want the gain of. Woman, like prudent man thou kindly speakest. And I, thus having heard thy trusty tokens, The gods to rightly hail forthwith prepare me; For, grace that must be paid has crowned our labours. The stroke of Zeus — they have it, as men say! This, at least, from the source track forth we may! As he ordained, so has he done. That they do care, has been made plain To offspring of the over-bold, Outbreathing Houses that spill with more than they can hold, More than is best for man. Be man’s what must Keep harm off, so that in himself he find Sufficiency — the well-endowed of mind! For there’s no bulwark in man’s wealth to him Who, through a surfeit, kicks — into the dim And disappearing — Right’s great altar. Soon shall we know — of these light-bearing torches, And beacons and exchanges, fire with fire — If they are true, indeed, or if, dream-fashion, This gladsome light came and deceived our judgment. Yon herald from the shore I see, o’ershadowed With boughs of olive: dust, mud’s thirsty brother, Close neighbours on his garb, thus testify me That neither voiceless, nor yet kindling for thee Mountain-wood-flame, shall he explain by fire-smoke: But either tell out more the joyance, speaking .. Word contrary to which, I aught but love it! For may good be — to good that’s known — appendage! Whoever prays for aught else to this city — May he himself reap fruit of his mind’s error! Ha, my forefathers’ soil of earth Argeian! Thee, in this year’s tenth light, am I returned to — Of many broken hopes, on one hope chancing; For never prayed I, in this earth Argeian Dying, to share my part in tomb the dearest. Now, hail thou earth, and hail thou also, sunlight, And Zeus, the country’s lord, and king the Puthian From bow no longer urging at us arrows! Enough, beside Skamandros, cam’st thou adverse: Now, contrary, be saviour thou and healer, O king Apollon! And gods conquest-granting, All — I invoke too, and my tutelary Hermes, dear herald, heralds’ veneration, — And Heroes our forthsenders, — friendly, once more The army to receive, the war-spear’s leavings! Ha, mansions of my monarchs, roofs beloved, And awful seats, and deities sun-fronting — Receive with pomp your monarch, long time absent! For he comes bringing light in night-time to you, In common with all these — king Agamemnon. But kindly greet him — for clear shows your duty — Who has dug under Of Zeus the Avenger, whereby plains are out-ploughed, Altars unrecognizable, and gods’ shrines, And the whole land’s seed thoroughly has perished. And such a yoke-strap having cast round The elder king Atreides, happy man — he Comes to be honoured, worthiest of what mortals Now are. Nor Paris nor the accomplice-city Outvaunts their deed as more than they are done-by: For, in a suit for rape and theft found guilty, He missed of plunder and, in one destruction, Fatherland, house and home has mowed to atoms: Debts the Priamidai have paid twice over. Hail, herald from the army of Achaians! I hail: — to die, will gainsay gods no longer! Love of this fatherland did exercise thee? So that I weep, at least, with joy, my eyes full. What, of this gracious sickness were ye gainers? How now? instructed, I this speech shall master. For those who loved you back, with longing stricken. This land yearned for the yearning army, say’st thou? So as to set me oft, from dark mind, groaning. Whence came this ill mind — hatred to the army? Of old, I use, for mischiefs physic, silence. And how, the chiefs away, did you fear any? So that now, — late thy word, — much joy were — dying! For well have things been worked out: these, — in much time, Some of them, one might say, had luck in falling, While some were faulty: since who, gods excepted, Goes, through the whole time of his life, ungrieving? For labours should I tell of, and bad lodgments, Narrow deckways ill-strewn, too, — what the day’s woe We did not groan at getting for our portion? As for land-things, again, on went more hatred! Since beds were ours hard by the foemen’s ramparts, And, out of heaven and from the earth, the meadow Dews kept a-sprinkle, an abiding damage Of vestures, making hair a wild-beast matting. Winter, too, if one told of it — bird-slaying — Such as, unbearable, Idaian snow brought — Or heat, when waveless, on its noontide couches Without a wind, the sea would slumber falling — Why must one mourn these? O’er and gone is labour: O’er and gone is it, even to those dead ones, So that no more again they mind uprising. Why must we tell in numbers those deprived ones, And the live man be vexed with fate’s fresh outbreak? Rather, I bid full farewell to misfortunes! For us, the left from out the Argeian army, The gain beats, nor does sorrow counterbalance. So that ’t is fitly boasted of, this sunlight, By us, o’er sea and land the aery flyers, Such things men having heard must praise the city And army-leaders: and the grace which wrought them — Of Zeus, shall honoured be. Thou hast my whole word. O’ercome by words, their sense I do not gainsay. For, aye this breeds youth in the old — But these things most the house and Klutaimnestra Concern, ’t is likely: while they make me rich, too. I shouted long ago, indeed, for joyance, When came that first night-messenger of fire Proclaiming And someone, girding me, said, By such words I was made seem wit-bewildered: Yet still I sacrificed; and, — female-song with, — A shout one man and other, through the city, Set up, congratulating in the gods’ seats, Soothing the incense-eating flame right fragrant. And now, what’s more, indeed, why need’st thou tell me? I of the king himself shall learn the whole word: And, — as may best be, — I my revered husband Shall hasten, as he comes back, to receive: for — What’s to a wife sweeter to see than this light (Her husband, by the god saved, back from warfare) So as to open gates? This tell my husband — To come at soonest to his loving city. A faithful wife at home may he find, coming! Such an one as he left — the dog o’ the household — Trusty to him, adverse to the ill-minded, And, in all else, the same: no signet-impress Having done harm to, in that time’s duration. I know nor pleasure, nor blameworthy converse With any other man more than — bronze-dippings! Such boast as this — brimful of the veracious — Is, for a high-born dame, not bad to send forth! Ay, she spoke thus to thee — that hast a knowledge From clear interpreters — a speech most seemly. But speak thou, herald! Meneleos I ask of: If he, returning, back in safety also Will come with you — this land’s beloved chieftain? There’s no way I might say things false and pleasant For friends to reap the fruits of through a long time. How then if, speaking good, things true thou chance on? For not well-hidden things become they, sundered. The man has vanished from the Achaic army, He and his ship too. I announce no falsehood. Whether forth-putting openly from Or did storm — wide woe — snatch him from the army? Like topping bowman, thou hast touched the target, And a long sorrow hast succinctly spoken. Whether, then, of him, as a live or dead man Was the report by other sailors bruited? Nobody knows so as to tell out clearly Excepting Helios who sustains earth’s nature. How say’st thou then, did storm the naval army Attack and end, by the celestials’ anger? It suits not to defile a day auspicious With ill-announcing speech: distinct each god’s due: And when a messenger with gloomy visage To a city bears a fall’n host’s woes— God ward off! — One popular wound that happens to the city, And many sacrificed from many households — Men, scourged by that two-thonged whip Ares loves so, Double spear-headed curse, bloody yoke-couple, — Of woes like these, doubtless, whoe’er comes weighted, Him does it suit to sing the Erinues’ paian. But who, of matters saved a glad-news-bringer, Comes to a city in good estate rejoicing. ... How shall I mix good things with evil, telling Of storm against the Achaioi, urged by gods’ wrath? For they swore league, being arch-foes before that, Fire and the sea: and plighted troth approved they, Destroying the unhappy Argeian army. At night began the bad-wave-outbreak evils; For, ships against each other Threkian breezes Shattered: and these, butted at in a fury By storm and typhoon, with surge rain-resounding, — Off they went, vanished, thro’ a bad herd’s whirling. And, when returned the brilliant light of Helios, We view the Aigaian sea on flower with corpses Of men Achaian and with naval ravage. But us indeed, and ship, unhurt i’ the hull too, Either someone outstole us or outprayed us — Some god — no man it was the tiller touching. And Fortune, saviour, willing on our ship sat. So as it neither had in harbour wave-surge Nor ran aground against a shore all rocky. And then, the water-Haides having fled from In the white day, not trusting to our fortune, We chewed the cud in thoughts — this novel sorrow O’ the army labouring and badly pounded. And now — if anyone of them is breathing — They talk of us as having perished: why not? And we — that they the same fate have, imagine. May it be for the best! Meneleos, then, Foremost and specially to come, expect thou! If (that is) any ray o’ the sun reports him Living and seeing too—by Zeus’ contrivings, Not yet disposed to quite destroy the lineage — Some hope is he shall come again to household. Having heard such things, know, thou truth art hearing! Who may he have been that named thus wholly with exactitude — (Was he someone whom we see not, by forecastings of the future Guiding tongue in happy mood?) — Her with battle for a bridegroom, on all sides contention-wooed, Helena? Since — mark the suture! — Ship’s-Hell, Man’s-Hell, City’s-Hell, From the delicately-pompous curtains that pavilion well, Forth, by favour of the gale Of earth-born Zephuros did she sail. Many shield-bearers, leaders of the pack, Sailed too upon their track, Theirs who had directed oar, Then visible no more, To Simois’ leaf-luxuriant shore — For sake of strife all gore! First, indeed, ’T is right addressing — those with me the partners In this return and right things done the city Of Priamos: gods who, from no tongue hearing The rights o’ the cause, for Into the bloody vase, not oscillating, Put the vote-pebbles, while, o’ the rival vessel, Hope rose up to the lip-edge: filled it was not. By smoke the captured city is still conspicuous: Até’s burnt offerings live: and, dying with them, The ash sends forth the fulsome blasts of riches. Of these things, to the gods grace many-mindful ’T is right I render, since both nets outrageous We built them round with, and, for sake of woman, It did the city to dust — the Argeian monster, The horse’s nestling, the shield-bearing people That made a leap, at setting of the Pleiads, And, vaulting o’er the tower, the raw-flesh-feeding Lion licked up his fill of blood tyrannic. I to the gods indeed prolonged this preface; But — as for I say the same, and thou co-pleader hast me. Since few of men this faculty is born with — To honour, without grudge, their friend, successful. For moody, on the heart, a poison seated Its burthen doubles to who gained the sickness: By his own griefs he is himself made heavy, And out-of-door prosperity seeing groans at. Knowing, I’d call (for well have I experienced) Those seeming to be mighty gracious to me: While just Odusseus — he who sailed not willing — When joined on, was to me the ready trace-horse. This of him, whether dead or whether living, I say. For other city-and-gods’ concernment — Appointing common courts, in full assemblage We will consult. And as for what holds seemly — How it may lasting stay well, must be counselled: While what has need of medicines Paionian We, either burning or else cutting kindly, Will make endeavour to turn pain from sickness. And now into the domes and homes by altar Going, I to the gods first raise the right-hand — They who, far sending, back again have brought me. And Victory, since she followed, fixed remain she! Men, citizens, Argeians here, my worships! I shall not shame me, consort-loving manners To tell before you: for in time there dies off The diffidence from people. Not from others Learning, I of myself will tell the hard life I bore so long as this man was ’neath First: for a woman, from the male divided, To sit at home alone, is monstrous evil — Hearing the many rumours back-revenging: And for now This to come, now That bring after Woe, and still worse woe, bawling in the household! And truly, if so many wounds had chanced on My husband here, as homeward used to dribble Report, he’s pierced more than a net to speak of! While, were he dying (as the words abounded) A triple-bodied Geruon the Second, Plenty above — for loads below I count not — Of earth a three-share cloak he’d boast of taking, Once only dying in each several figure! Because of suchlike rumours back-revenging, Many the halters from my neck, above head, Others than From this cause, sure, the boy stands not beside me — Possessor of our troth-plights, thine and mine too — As ought Orestes: be not thou astonished! For, him brings up our well-disposed guest-captive Strophios the Phokian — ills that told on both sides To me predicting — both of thee ’neath The danger, and if anarchy’s mob-uproar Should overthrow thy council; since ’t is born with Mortals, — whoe’er has fallen, the more to kick him. Such an excuse, I think, no cunning carries! Offspring of Leda, of my household warder, Suitably to my absence hast thou spoken, For long the speech thou didst outstretch! But aptly To praise — from others ought to go this favour. And for the rest, —-not me, in woman’s fashion, Mollify, nor — as mode of barbarous man is — To me gape forth a groundward-falling clamour! Nor, strewing it with garments, make my passage Envied! Gods, sure, with these behoves we honour: But, for a mortal on these varied beauties To walk — to me, indeed, is nowise fear-free. I say — as man, not god, to me do homage! Apart from foot-mats both and varied vestures, Renown is loud, and  —  not to lose one’s senses, God’s greatest gift. Behoves we him call happy Who has brought life to end in loved well-being. If all things I might manage thus — brave man, I! Come now, this say, nor feign a feeling to me! With feeling, know indeed, I do not tamper! Vowed’st thou to the gods, in fear, to act thus? If any, I well knew resolve I outspoke. What think’st thou Priamos had done, thus victor? On varied vests — I do think — he had passaged. Then, do not, struck with awe at human censure .... Well, popular mob-outcry much avails too. Ay, but the unenvied is not the much valued. Sure, ’t is no woman’s part to long for battle. Why, to the prosperous, even suits a beating. What? thou this beating us in war dost prize too? Persuade thee! power, for once, grant But if this seem so to thee — shoes, let someone Loose under, quick — foot’s serviceable carriage! And me, on these sea-products walking, may no Grudge from a distance, from the god’s eye, strike at! For great shame were my strewment-spoiling — riches Spoiling with feet, and silver-purchased textures! Of these things, thus then. But this female-stranger Tenderly take inside! Who conquers mildly God, from afar, benignantly regardeth. For, willing, no one wears a yoke that’s servile: And she, of many valuables, outpicked The flower, the army’s gift, myself has followed. So, — since to hear thee, I am brought about thus, — I go into the palace — purples treading. There is the sea — and what man shall exhaust it? — Feeding much purple’s worth-its-weight-in-silver Dye, ever fresh and fresh, our garments’ tincture; At home, such wealth, king, we begin — by gods’ help — With having, and to lack, the household knows not. Of many garments had I vowed a treading (In oracles if fore-enjoined the household) Of this dear soul the safe-return-price scheming! For, root existing, foliage goes up houses, O’erspreading shadow against Seirios dog-star; And, thou returning to the hearth domestic, Warmth, yea, in winter dost thou show returning. And when, too, Zeus works, from the green-grape acrid, Vine — then, already, cool in houses cometh — The perfect man his home perambulating! Zeus, Zeus Perfecter, these my prayers perfect thou! Thy care be — yea — of things thou mayst make perfect! Wherefore to me, this fear — Groundedly stationed here Fronting my heart, the portent-watcher — flits she? Wherefore should prophet-play The uncalled and unpaid lay, Nor — having spat forth fear, like bad dreams — sits she On the mind’s throne beloved — well-suasive Boldness? For time, since, by a throw of all the hands, The boat’s stern-cables touched the sands, Has past from youth to oldness, — When under Take thyself in, thou too — I say, Kassandra! Since Zeus — not angrily—in household placed thee Partaker of hand-sprinklings, with the many Slaves stationed, his the Owner’s altar close to. Descend from out this car, nor be high-minded And truly they do say Alkmené’s child once Bore being sold, slaves’ barley-bread his living. If, then, necessity of this lot o’erbalance, Much is the favour of old-wealthy masters: For those who, never hoping, made fine harvest Are harsh to slaves in all things, beyond measure. Thou hast — with us — such usage as law warrants. To thee it was, she paused plain speech from speaking. Being inside the fatal nets — obeying, Thou mayst obey: but thou mayst disobey too! Why, if she is not, in the swallow’s fashion, Possessed of voice that’s unknown and barbaric, I, with speech — speaking in mind’s scope — persuade her. Follow! The best — as things now stand — she speaks of. Obey thou, leaving this thy car-enthronement! Well, with this thing at door, for me no leisure To waste time: as concerns the hearth mid-navelled, Already stand the sheep for fireside slaying By those who never hoped to have such favour. If thou, then, aught of this wilt do, delay not! But if thou, being witless, tak’st no word in, Speak thou, instead of voice, with hand as She seems a plain interpreter in need of, The stranger! and her way — a beast’s new-captured! Why, she is mad, sure, — hears her own bad senses, — Who, while she comes, leaving a town new-captured, Yet knows not how to bear the bit o’ the bridle Before she has out-frothed her bloody fierceness. Not I — throwing away more words — will shamed be! But I, — for I compassionate, — will chafe not. Come, O unhappy one, this car vacating, Yielding to this necessity, prove yoke’s use! Otototoi, Gods, Earth, — Apollon, Apollon! Why didst thou Since he is none such as to suit a mourner. Otototoi, Gods, Earth, — Apollon, Apollon! Ill-boding here again the god invokes she — Nowise empowered in woes to stand by helpful. Apollon, Apollon, Guard of the ways, my destroyer! For thou hast quite, this second time, destroyed me. To prophesy she seems of her own evils: Remains the god-gift to the slave-soul present. Apollon, Apollon, Guard of the ways, my destroyer! Ha, whither hast thou led me? to what roof now? To the Atreidai’s roof: if this thou know’st not, I tell it thee, nor this wilt thou call falsehood. How! How! God-hated, then! Of many a crime it knew — Self-slaying evils, halters too: Man’s-shambles, blood-besprinkler of the ground! She seems to be good-nosed, the stranger: dog-like, She snuffs indeed the victims she will find there. How! How! By the witnesses here I am certain now! These children bewailing their slaughters — flesh dressed in the fire And devoured by their sire! Ay, we have heard of thy soothsaying glory, Doubtless: but prophets none are we in scent of! Ah, gods, what ever does she meditate? What this new anguish great? Great in the house here she meditates ill Such as friends cannot bear, cannot cure it: and still Off stands all Resistance Afar in the distance! Of these I witless am — these prophesyings. But those I knew: for the whole city bruits them. Ah, unhappy one, this thou consummatest? Thy husband, thy bed’s common guest, In the bath having brightened. .. How shall I declare Consummation? It soon will be there: For hand after hand she outstretches, At life as she reaches! Nor yet I’ve gone with thee! for — after riddles — Now, in blind oracles, I feel resourceless. Eh, eh, papai, papai, What this, I espy? Some net of Haides undoubtedly Nay, rather, the snare Is she who has share In his bed, who takes part in the murder there! But may a revolt — Unceasing assault — On the Race, raise a shout Sacrificial, about A victim — by stoning — For murder atoning! What this Erinus which i’ the house thou callest To raise her cry? Not me thy word enlightens! To my heart has run A drop of the crocus-dye: Which makes for those On earth by the spear that lie, A common close With life’s descending sun. Swift is the curse begun! How! How! See — see quick! Keep the bull from the cow! In the vesture she catching him, strikes him now With the black-horned trick, And he falls in the watery vase! Of the craft-killing cauldron I tell thee the case! I would not boast to be a topping critic Of oracles: but to some sort of evil I liken these. From oracles, what good speech To mortals, beside, is sent? It comes of their evils: these arts word-abounding that sing the event Bring the fear’t is their office to teach. Ah me, ah me — Of me unhappy, evil-destined fortunes! For I bewail my proper woe As, mine with his, all into one I throw. Why hast thou hither me unhappy brought? — Unless that I should die with him — for nought! What else was sought? Thou art some mind-mazed creature, god-possessed: And all about thyself dost wail A lay — no lay! Like some brown nightingale Insatiable of noise, who — well-away! — From her unhappy breast Keeps moaning Itus, Itus, and his life With evils, flourishing on each side, rife. Ah me, ah me, The fate o’ the nightingale, the clear resounder! For a body wing-borne have the gods cast round her, And sweet existence, from misfortunes free: But for myself remains a sundering With spear, the two-edged thing! Whence hast thou this on-rushing god-involving pain And spasms in vain? For, things that terrify, With changing unintelligible cry Thou strikest up in tune, yet all the while After that Orthian style! Whence hast thou limits to the oracular road, That evils bode? Ah me, the nuptials, the nuptials of Paris, the deadly to friends! Ah me, of Skamandros the draught Paternal! There once, to these ends, On thy banks was I brought, The unhappy! And now, by Kokutos and Acheron’s shore I shall soon be, it seems, these my oracles singing once more! Why this word, plain too much, Hast thou uttered? A babe might learn of such! I am struck with a bloody bite — here under — At the fate woe-wreaking Of thee shrill shrieking: To me who hear — a wonder! Ah me, the toils — the toils of the city The wholly destroyed: ah, pity, Of the sacrificings my father made In the ramparts’ aid — Much slaughter of grass-fed flocks — that afforded no cure That the city should not, as it does now, the burthen endure! But I, with the soul on fire, Soon to the earth shall cast me and expire. To things, on the former consequent, Again hast thou given vent: And ’t is some evil-meaning fiend doth move thee, Heavily falling from above thee, To melodize thy sorrows — else, in singing, Calamitous, death-bringing! And of all this the end I am without resource to apprehend Well then, the oracle from veils no longer Shall be outlooking, like a bride new-married: But bright it seems, against the sun’s uprisings Breathing, to penetrate thee: so as, wave-like, To wash against the rays a woe much greater Than this. I will no longer teach by riddles. And witness, running with me, that of evils Done long ago, I nosing track the footstep! For, this same roof here — never quits a Choros One-voiced, not well-tuned since no And truly having drunk, to get more courage, Man’s blood — the Komos keeps within the household — Hard to be sent outside — of sister Furies: They hymn their hymn — within the house close sitting — The first beginning curse: in turn spit forth at The Brother’s bed, to him who spurned it hostile. Have I missed aught, or hit I like a bowman? False prophet am I, — knock at doors, a babbler? Henceforward witness, swearing now, I know not By other’s word the old sins of this household! And how should oath, bond honourably binding, Become thy cure? No less I wonder at thee — That thou, beyond sea reared, a strange-tongued city Shouldst hit in speaking, just as if thou stood’st by! Prophet Apollon put me in this office. What, even though a god, with longing smitten? At first, indeed, shame was to me to say this. For, more relaxed grows everyone who fares well. But he was athlete to me — huge grace breathing! Well, to the work of children, went ye law’s way? Having consented, I played false to Loxias. Already when the wits inspired possessed of? Already townsmen all their woes I foretold. How wast thou then unhurt by Loxias’ anger? I no one aught persuaded, when I sinned thus. To us, at least, now sooth to say thou seemest. Halloo, halloo, ah, evils! Again, straightforward foresight’s fearful labour Whirls me, distracting with prelusive last-lays! Behold ye those there, in the household seated, — Young ones, — of dreams approaching to the figures? Children, as if they died by their beloveds — Hands they have filled with flesh, the meal domestic — Entrails and vitals both, most piteous burthen, Plain they are holding! — which their father tasted! For this, I say, plans punishment a certain Lion ignoble, on the bed that wallows, House-guard (ah, me!) to the returning master — Mine, since to bear the slavish yoke behoves me! The ship’s commander, Knows not what things the tongue of the lewd she-dog Speaking, outspreading, shiny-souled, in fashion Of Até hid, will reach to, by ill fortune! Such things she dares — the female, the male’s slayer! She is . . . how calling her the hateful bite-beast May I hit the mark? Some amphisbaina, — Skulla Housing in rocks, of mariners the mischief, Revelling Haides’ mother, — curse, no truce with, Breathing at friends! How piously she shouted, The all-courageous, as at turn of battle! She seems to joy at the back-bringing safety! Of this, too, if I nought persuade, all’s one! Why? What is to be will come. And soon thou, present, Thuestes’ feast, indeed, on flesh of children, I went with, and I shuddered. Fear too holds me Listing what’s true as life, nowise out-imaged. I say, thou Agamemnon’s fate shalt look on. Speak good words, O unhappy! Set mouth sleeping! But Paian stands in no stead to the speech here. Nay, if the thing be near: but never be it! Thou, indeed, prayest: they to kill are busy. Of what man is it ministered, this sorrow? There again, wide thou look’st of my foretellings. For, the fulfiller’s scheme I have not gone with. And yet too well I know the speech Hellenic. For Puthian oracles, thy speech, and hard too. Papai: what fire this! and it comes upon me! Ototoi, Lukeion Apollon, ah me — me! She, the two-footed lioness that sleeps with The wolf, in absence of the generous lion, Kills me the unhappy one: and as a poison Brewing, to put my price too in the anger, She vows, against her mate this weapon whetting To pay him back the bringing me, with slaughter. Why keep I then these things to make me laughed at, Both wands and, round my neck, oracular fillets? Thee, at least, ere my own fate will I ruin: Go, to perdition falling! Boons exchange we — Some other Até in my stead make wealthy! See there — himself, Apollon stripping from me The oracular garment! having looked upon me — Even in these adornments, laughed by friends at, As good as foes, i’ the balance weighed: and vainly — For, called crazed stroller, — as I had been gipsy, Beggar, unhappy, starved to death, — I bore it. And now the Prophet — prophet me undoing, Has led away to these so deadly fortunes! Instead of my sire’s altar, waits the hack-block She struck with first warm bloody sacrificing! Yet nowise unavenged of gods will death be: For there shall come another, our avenger, The mother-slaying scion, father’s doomsman: Fugitive, wanderer, from this land an exile, Back shall he come, — for friends, copestone these curses! For there is sworn a great oath from the gods that Him shall bring hither his fallen sire’s prostration. Why make I then, like an indweller, moaning? Since at the first I foresaw Suffering as it has suffered: and who took it, Thus by the judgment of the gods are faring. I go, will suffer, will submit to dying! But, Haides’ gates — these same I call, I speak to, And pray that on an opportune blow chancing, Without a struggle, — blood the calm death bringing In easy outflow, — I this eye may close up! O much unhappy, but, again, much learned Woman, long hast thou outstretched! But if truly Thou knowest thine own fate, how comes that, like to A god-led steer, to altar bold thou treadest? There’s no avoidance, — strangers, no some time more! He last is, anyhow, by time advantaged. It comes, the day: I shall by flight gain little. But know thou patient art from thy brave spirit! Such things hears no one of the happy-fortuned. But gloriously to die — for man is grace, sure. Ah, sire, for thee and for thy noble children! But what thing is it? What fear turns thee backwards? Alas, alas! Why this Slaughter blood-dripping does the household smell of! How else? This scent is of hearth-sacrifices. Such kind of steam as from a tomb is proper! No Surian honour to the House thou speak’st of! But I will go, — even in the household wailing My fate and Agamemnon’s. Life suffice me! Ah, strangers! I cry not Idly! to me, the dead this much bear witness: When, for me — woman, there shall die a woman, And, for a man ill-wived, a man shall perish! This hospitality I ask as dying. O sufferer, thee — thy foretold fate I pity. Yet once for all, to speak a speech, I fain am: No dirge, mine for myself! The sun I pray to, Fronting his last light! — to my own avengers — That from my hateful slayers they exact too Pay for the dead slave — easy-managed hand’s work! Alas for mortal matters! Happy-fortuned, — Why, any shade would turn them: if unhappy, By throws the wetting sponge has spoiled the picture! And more by much in mortals this I pity. The being well-to-do — Insatiate a desire of this Born with all mortals is, Nor any is there who Well-being forces off, aroints From roofs whereat a finger points, To take the city of Priamos did the celestials give, And, honoured by the god, he homeward comes; But now if, of the former, he shall pay The blood back, and, for those who ceased to live, Dying, for deaths in turn new punishment he dooms— Who, being mortal, would not pray With an unmischievous Daimon to have been born — who would not, hearing thus? Ah me! I am struck — a right-aimed stroke within me! Silence! Who is it shouts Ah me! indeed again, — a second, struck by! This work seems to me completed by this But we somehow may together share in solid counsellings. I, in the first place, my opinion tell you: — To cite the townsmen, by help-cry, to house here. To me, it seems we ought to fall upon them At quickest — prove the fact by sword fresh-flowing! And I, of such opinion the partaker, Vote — to do something: not to wait — the main point! ’T is plain to see: for they prelude as though of A tyranny the signs they gave the city. For we waste time; while they, — this waiting’s glory Treading to ground, — allow the hand no slumber. I know not — chancing on some plan — to tell it: ’T is for the doer to plan of the deed also. And I am such another: since I’m schemeless How to raise up again by words — a dead man! What, and, protracting life, shall we give way thus To the disgracers of our home, these rulers? Why, ’t is unbearable: but to die is better: For death than tyranny is the riper finish! What, by the testifying Shall we prognosticate the man as perished? We must quite know ere speak these things concerning: For to conjecture and This same to praise I from all sides abound in — Clearly to know — Atreides, what he’s doing! Much having been before to purpose spoken, The opposite to say I shall not shamed be: For how should one, to enemies, — in semblance, Friends, — enmity proposing, — sorrow’s net-frame Enclose, a height superior to outleaping? To me, indeed, this struggle of old — not mindless Of an old victory — came: with time, I grant you! I stand where I have struck, things once accomplished: And so have done, — and this deny I shall not, — As that his fate was nor to fly nor ward off. A wrap-round with no outlet, as for fishes, I fence about him — the rich woe of the garment: I strike him twice, and in a double He let his limbs go — there! And to him, fallen, The third blow add I, giving — of Below-ground Zeus, guardian of the dead — the votive favour. Thus in the mind of him he rages, falling, And blowing forth a brisk blood-spatter, strikes me With the dark drop of slaughterous dew — rejoicing No less than, at the god-given dewy-comfort, The sown-stuff in its birth-throes from the calyx. Since so these things are, — Argives, my revered here, — Ye may rejoice — if ye rejoice: but I — boast! If it were fit on corpse to pour libation, That would be right — right over and above, too! The cup of evils in the house he, having Filled with such curses, himself coming drinks of. We wonder at thy tongue: since bold-mouthed truly Is she who in such speech boasts o’er her husband I Ye test me as I were a witless woman: But I — with heart intrepid — to you knowers Say (and thou — if thou wilt or praise or blame me, Comes to the same) — this man is Agamemnon, My husband, dead, the work of the right hand here, Ay, of a just artificer: so things are. What evil, O woman, food or drink, earth-bred Or sent from the flowing sea, Of such having fed Didst thou set on thee This sacrifice And popular cries Of a curse on thy head? Off thou hast thrown him, off hast cut The man from the city: but — Off from the city thyself shalt be Cut — to the citizens A hate immense! Now, indeed, thou adjudgest exile to me, And citizens’ hate, and to have popular curses: Nothing of this against the man here bringing, Who, no more awe-checked than as ’t were a beast’s fate, — With sheep abundant in the well-fleeced graze-flocks, — Sacrificed his child, — dearest fruit of travail To me, — as song-spell against Threkian blowings. Not him did it behove thee hence to banish — Pollution’s penalty? But hearing mzy deeds Justicer rough thou art! Now, this I tell thee: To threaten thus — me, one prepared to have thee (On like conditions, thy hand conquering) o’er me Rule: but if God the opposite ordain us, Thou shalt learn — late taught, certes — to be modest. Greatly-intending thou art: Much-mindful, too, hast thou cried (Since thy mind, with its slaughter-outpouring part, Is frantic) that over the eyes, a patch Of blood — with blood to match — Is plain for a pride! Yet still, bereft of friends, thy fate Is — blow with blow to expiate! And this thou hearest — of my oaths, just warrant! By who fulfilled things for my daughter, Justice, Até, Erinus, — by whose help I slew him, — Not mine the fancy — Fear will tread my palace So long as on my hearth there burns a fire, Aigisthos as before well-caring for me; Since he to me is shield, no small, of boldness. Here does he lie — outrager of this female, Dainty of all the Chruseids under And she — the captive, the soothsayer also And couchmate of this man, oracle-speaker, Faithful bed-fellow, — ay, the sailors’ benches They wore in common, nor unpunished did so, Since he is — thus! While, as for her, — swan-fashion, Her latest having chanted, — dying wailing She lies, — to him, a sweetheart: me she brought to — My bed’s by-nicety — the whet of dalliance. Alas, that some Fate would come Upon us in quickness — Neither much sickness Neither bed-keeping — And bear unended sleeping, Now that subdued Is our keeper, the kindest of mood! Having borne, for a woman’s sake, much strife — By a woman he withered from life! Nowise, of death the fate — Burdened by these things — supplicate! Nor on Helena turn thy wrath As the man-destroyer, as And wrought immense annoy! Daimon, who fallest Upon this household and the double-raced Tantalidai, a rule, minded like theirs displaced, Thou rulest me with, now, Whose heart thou gallest! And on the body, like a hateful crow, Stationed, all out of tune, his chant to chant Doth Something vaunt! Now, of a truth, hast thou set upright Thy mouth’s opinion, — Naming the Sprite, The triply gross, O’er the race that has dominion: For through him it is that Eros The carnage-licker In the belly is bred: ere ended quite Is the elder throe — new ichor! Certainly, great of might And heavy of wrath, the Sprite Thou tellest of, in the palace (Woe, woe!) — An evil tale of a fate By Até’s malice Rendered insatiate! Thou boastest this deed to be mine: But leave off styling me For, showing himself in sign Of the spouse of the corpse thou dost see, Did the ancient bitter avenging-ghost Of Atreus, savage host, Pay the man here as price — A full-grown for the young one’s sacrifice. That no cause, indeed, of this killing art thou, Who shall be witness-bearer? How shall he bear it — how? But the sire’s avenging-ghost might be in the deed a sharer. He is forced on and on By the kin-born flowing of blood, — Black Ares: to where, having gone, He shall leave off, flowing done, At the frozen-child’s-flesh food. No death Do I think this man’s to be: For did not himself a slavish curse To his household decree? But the scion of him, myself did nurse — That much-bewailed Iphigeneia, he Having done well by, — and as well, nor worse, Been done to, — let him not in Haides loudly Bear himself proudly! Being by sword-destroying death amerced For that sword’s punishment himself inflicted first. I at a loss am left — Of a feasible scheme of mind bereft — Where I may turn: for the house is falling: I fear the bloody crash of the rain That ruins the roof as it bursts amain: The warning-drop Has come to a stop. Destiny doth Justice whet For other deed of hurt, on other whetstones yet. It belongs not to thee to declare This object of care! By us did he fall — down there! Did he die — down there! and down, no less, We will bury him there, and not beneath The wails of the household over his death: But Iphigeneia, — with kindliness, — His daughter, — as the case requires, Facing him full, at the rapid-flowing Passage of Groans shall — both hands throwing Around him — kiss that kindest of sires! This blame comes in the place of blame: Hard battle it is to judge each claim. And this remains while Zeus is remaining, Who may cast out of the House its cursed brood? The race is to Até glued! Thou hast gone into this oracle With a true result. For me, then, — I will — To the Daimon of the Pleisthenidai Making an oath — with all these things comply Hard as they are to bear. For the rest — Going from out this House, a guest, May he wear some other family To nought, with the deaths of kin by kin! And, — keeping a little part of my goods, — Wholly am I contented in Having expelled from the royal House These frenzied moods The mutually-murderous. O light propitious of day justice-bringing! I may say truly, now, that men’s avengers, The gods from high, of earth behold the sorrows — Seeing, as I have, i’ the spun robes of the Erinues, This man here lying, — sight to me how pleasant! — His father’s hands’ contrivances repaying. For Atreus, this land’s lord, of this man father, Thuestes, my own father — to speak clearly — His brother too, — being i’ the rule contested, — Drove forth to exile from both town and household: And, coming back, to the hearth turned, a suppliant, Wretched Thuestes found the fate assured him — Not to die, bloodying his paternal threshold Just there: but host-wise this man’s impious father Atreus, soul-keenly more than kindly, — seeming To joyous hold a flesh-day, — to my father Served up a meal, the flesh of his own children. The feet indeed and the hands’ top divisions He hid, high up and isolated sitting: But, their unshowing parts in ignorance taking, He forthwith eats food — as thou seest — perdition To the race: and then, ’ware of the deed ill-omened, He shrieked O! — falls back, vomiting, from the carnage, And fate on the Pelopidai past bearing He prays down — putting in his curse together The kicking down o’ the feast — that so might perish The race of Pleisthenes entire: and thence is That it is given thee to see this man prostrate. And I was rightly of this slaughter stitch-man: Since me, — being third from ten, — with my poor father He drives out — being then a babe in swathe-bands: But, grown up, back again has justice brought me: And of this man I got hold — being without-doors — Fitting together the whole scheme of ill-will. So, sweet, in fine, even to die were to me, Seeing, as I have, this man i’ the toils of justice! Aigisthos, arrogance in ills I love not. Dost thou say — willing, thou didst kill the man here, And, alone, plot this lamentable slaughter? I say — thy head in justice will escape not The people’s throwing — know that! — stones and curses! Thou such things soundest — seated at the lower Oarage to those who rule at the ship’s mid-bench? Thou shalt know, being old, how heavy is teaching To one of the like age — bidden be modest! But chains and old age and the pangs of fasting Stand out before all else in teaching, — prophets At souls’-cure! Dost not, seeing aught, see this too? Against goads kick not, lest tript-up thou suffer! Woman, thou, — of him coming new from battle Houseguard — thy husband’s bed the while disgracing, — For the Army-leader didst thou plan this fate too? These words too are of groans the prime-begetters! Truly a tongue opposed to Orpheus hast thou: Foi he led all things by his voice’s grace-charm, But thou, upstirring them by these wild yelpings, Wilt lead them! Forced, thou wilt appear the tamer! So — thou shalt be my king then of the Argeians — Who, not when for this man his fate thou plannedst, Daredst to do this deed — thyself the slayer! For, to deceive him was the wife’s part, certes:  But out of this man’s wealth will I endeavour To rule the citizens: and the no-man-minder — Him will I heavily yoke — by no means trace-horse, A corned-up colt! but that bad friend in darkness, Famine its housemate, shall behold him gentle. Why then, this man here, from a coward spirit, Didst not thou slay thyself? But, — helped, — a woman, The country’s pest, and that of gods o’ the country, Killed him! Orestes, where may he see light now? That coming hither back, with gracious fortune, Of both these he may be the all-conquering slayer? But since this to do thou thinkest — and not talk — thou soon shalt know! Up then, comrades dear! the proper thing to do—not distant this! Up then! hilt in hold, his sword let everyone aright dispose! Ay, but I myself too, hilt in hold, do not refuse to die. Thou wilt die, thou say’st, to who accept it. We the chance demand. Nowise, O belovedest of men, may we do other ills! To have reaped away these, even, is a harvest much to me. Go, both thou and these the old men, to the homes appointed each, Ere ye suffer! It behoved one do these things just as we did: And if of these troubles there should be enough — we may assent — By the Daimon’s heavy heel unfortunately stricken ones! So a woman’s counsel hath it — if one judge it learning-worth. But to think that these at me the idle tongue should thus o’erbloom, And throw out such words — the Daimon’s power experimenting on — And, of modest knowledge missing, — me, the ruler, . . . Ne’er may this befall Argeians — wicked man to fawn before! Anyhow, in after days, will I, yes, I, be at thee yet! Not if hither should the Daimon make Orestes straightway come! O, I know, myself, that fugitives on hopes are pasture-fed! Do thy deed, get fat, defiling justice, since the power is thine! Know that thou shalt give me satisfaction for this folly’s sake! Boast on, bearing thee audacious, like a cock his females by! Have not thou respect for these same idle yelpings! I and thou Will arrange it, o’er this household ruling excellently well.  \n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Always, son of for a long time as you hunt and scan his newly pressed tracks, in order to see whether he is inside or away.  Your course leads you well to your goal, like that of a keen-scenting Laconian hound.  For the man has just now gone in, with sweat dripping from his head and from his hands that have killed with the sword.  There is no further need for you to peer inside these doors.  Rather tell me what your goal is that you have shown such eagerness for, so that you may learn from her who holds the knowledge. Voice of Athena, dearest to me of the gods, how clearly, though you are unseen, do I hear your call and snatch its meaning in my mind, just as I would the bronze tongue of the Tyrrhenian trumpet!  And now you have discerned correctly that I am circling my path on the track of a man who hates me, Ajax the shield-bearer. It is he and no other that I have been tracking so long.  For tonight he has done us a deed beyond comprehension—if he is indeed the doer.  We know nothing for certain, but drift in doubt.  And so I of my of accord took up the burden of this search. For we recently found all the cattle, our plunder, dead—yes, slaughtered by human hand—and with them the guardians of the flocks. bounding alone over the plain with a newly-wet sword reported to me and declared what he saw.  Then immediately I rush upon his track, and sometimes I follow his signs, but sometimes I am bewildered, and cannot read whose they are.  Your arrival is timely, for truly in all matters, both those of the past and those of the future, it is your hand that steers me. I know it, Odysseus, and some time ago I came on the path as a lookout friendly to your hunt. And so, dear mistress, do I toil to good effect? Know that that man is the doer of these deeds. Then to what end did he thrust his hand so senselessly? He was mad with anger over the arms of Achilles. Why, then, his onslaught upon the flocks? It was in your blood, he thought, that he was staining his hand. Then was this a plot aimed against the Greeks? Yes, and he would have accomplished it, too, had I not been attentive. And what reckless boldness was in his mind that he dared this? Under night’s cover he set out against you, by stealth and alone. And did he get near us?  Did he reach his goal? He was already at the double doors of the two generals. How, then, did he restrain his hand when it was eager for murder? It was I who prevented him, by casting over his eyes oppressive notions of his fatal joy, and I who turned his fury aside on the flocks of sheep and the confused droves guarded by herdsmen, the spoil which you had not yet divided. Then he fell upon them and kept cutting out a slaughter of many horned beasts as he split their spines in a circle around him.  At one time he thought that he was killing the two Atreidae, holding them in his very hand;  at another time it was this commander, and at another that one which he attacked.  And I, while the man ran about in diseased frenzy, I kept urging him on, kept hurling him into the snares of doom.  Soon, when he rested from this toil, he bound together the living oxen along with with all the sheep and brought them home, as though his quarry were men, not well-horned cattle.  And now he abuses them, bound together, in the house. and keep them from landing on your face. You there, you who bind back your captive’s arms, I am calling you, come here! I am\\n                        calling Ajax! Come out in front of the house! What are you doing, Athena?  Do not call him out. Hold your peace!  Do not earn a reputation for cowardice! No, by the gods, let it content you that he stay inside. What is the danger?  Was he not a man before? Yes, a man hostile to me in the past, and especially now. And is not the sweetest mockery the mockery of enemies? I am content that he stay within his tent. Do you fear to see a madman right before your eyes? I would not shrink from him in fear, if he were sane. But he will not see you now, even though you stand nearby. How could that be, if he still sees with the same eyes? I shall darken them, though their sight is keen. It is true: all is possible when a god contrives. Stand silent, then, and stay where you are. I must stay.  But I would prefer to be far from here! You there, Ajax, once again I call you! Why do you show so little regard for your ally? Welcome, Athena!  Welcome, daughter sprung from Zeus!  How well have you stood by me!  I will crown you with trophies of pure gold in gratitude for this quarry! A fine pledge.  But tell me this—have you dyed your sword well in the Greek army? I can make that boast.  I do not deny it. And have you launched your armed hand against the Atreidae? Yes, so that never again will they dishonor Ajax. The men are dead, as I interpret your words. Dead they are.  Now let them rob me of my arms! I see.  And the son of That blasted fox!  You ask me where he is? Yes, I do.  I mean Odysseus, your adversary. My most pleasing prisoner, mistress, he sits inside.  I do not wish him to die just yet. Until you do what?  Or win what greater advantage? Until he be bound to a pillar beneath my roof— What evil, then, will you inflict on the poor man? —and have his back crimsoned by the lash, before he dies. Do not abuse the poor man so cruelly! In all else, Athena, I bid you take your pleasure, but he will pay this penalty and no other. Well, then, since it delights you to do so, put your arm to use; spare no portion of your plan. I go to my work.  And I give you this commission:  be always for me the close-standing ally that you have been for me today! Do you see, Odysseus, how great is the strength of the gods? Whom could you have found more prudent than this man, or better able to do what the situation demanded? I know of no one, but in his misery I pity him all the same, even though he hates me, because he is yoked beneath a ruinous delusion—I think of my own lot no less than his. For I see that all we who live are nothing more than phantoms or fleeting shadow. Therefore since you witness his fate, see that you yourself never utter an arrogant word against the gods, nor assume any swelling pride, if in the scales of fate you are weightier than another in strength of hand or in depth of ample wealth.  For a day can press down all human things, and a day can raise them up.  But the gods embrace men of sense and abhor the evil. Son of Telamon, you who hold your throne on wave-washed like the fluttering eye of the winged dove. the cattle of the Greeks, their spoil, prizes of the spear which had not yet been shared, how you killed them with flashing iron. and he wins much belief.  For now he tells tales concerning you that easily win belief, and each hearer rejoices with spiteful scorn at your burdens more than he who told. and you could not miss;  but if a man were to speak such things against me, he would win no belief.  It is on the powerful that envy creeps.  Yet the small without the great are a teetering tower of defence. For the lowly  stand most upright and prosperous when allied with the great, and the great when served by less. we lack the power to repel these charges without you, O King.  For when they have escaped your eye, they chatter like flocking birds.  But, terrified by a mighty vulture, perhaps, if you should appear, they would quickly cower without voice in silence. Was it Artemis ruler of bulls, Zeus’s daughter, that drove you, O powerful Rumor, O\\n                        mother of my shame, drove you against the herds of all our people?  Was she exacting retribution, perhaps, for a victory that had paid her no tribute, whether it was because she had been cheated of the glory of captured arms, or because a stag had been slain without gifts for recompense?  Or can the bronze-cuirassed Lord of War have had some cause for anger arising out of an alliance of spears, and taken vengeance for the outrage by contrivance shrouded in night? For never of your own heart alone, son of Telamon, would you have gone so far down the sinister path as to fall upon the flocks.  When the gods send madness, it cannot but reach its target, but may Zeus and Phoebus avert the evil rumor of the Greeks! or if it is he born of the abject line of Sisyphus, do not, my king, do not win me an evil name by keeping your face still hidden in the tent by the sea. Come now, up from your seat, wherever you are settled in this long-lived pause from battle and are making the flame of disaster blaze up to the sky!  The violent insolence of your enemies rushes fearlessly about in the breezy glens, while the tongues of all the army cackle out a load of grief. For me, sorrow stands firmly planted. Mates of the ship of Ajax, offspring of the race that springs from the Erechtheids, the\\n                        soil’s sons, cries of grief are the portion of us who care from afar for the\\n                        house of Telamon. Ajax, our terrible, mighty lord of untamed power, now lies plagued by a turbid storm of disease. And what is the heavy change from the fortune of yesterday which this night has produced? Daughter of Teleutas the Phrygian, speak, since for you his spear-won mate bold Ajax maintains his love, so that with some knowledge you could suggest an explanation. Oh, how am I to tell a tale too terrible for words? Grave as death is the suffering which you will hear.  By madness our glorious Ajax was seized in the night, and he has been subjected to utter disgrace.  All this you may see inside his dwelling—butchered victims bathed in blood, sacrifices of no hand but his. What report of the fiery warrior have you revealed to us, unbearable, nor yet escapable— a report which the great Danaans propound, which their powerful storytelling spreads! Ah,\\n                        me, I shudder at the future’s advancing step. In public view the man will\\n                        die because the dark sword in his frenzied hand massacred the herds and the horse-guiding herdsmen. Ah!  Then it was from there, from there that he came to me with his captive flock! Of part, he cut the throats on the floor inside;  some, striking their sides, he tore asunder.  Then he caught up two white-footed rams and sheared off the head of one and its tongue-tip, and flung them away; the other he bound upright to a pillar, and seizing a heavy strap from a horse’s harness\\n                        he flogged it with a whistling, doubled lash, while he cursed it with awful\\n                        imprecations which a god, and no mortal, had taught him. The time has come for each of us to veil his head and steal away on foot, or to sit and take on the swift yoke of rowing, giving her way to the sea-faring ship.  So angry are the threats which the brother-kings, the sons of Atreus, speed against us!  I fear to share in bitter death beneath an onslaught of stones, crushed at this man’s side, whom an untouchable fate holds in its grasp. It grips him no longer.  For like a southerly wind after it has started up sharply without bright lightning he grows calm.  And now in his right mind he has new pain. To look on self-made suffering, when no other has had a hand in it—this induces sharp pains. But if he has stopped his madness, I have good hope that all may yet be well, since the trouble is of less account once it has passed. And which, if the choice were given you, would you choose—to distress your friends, and have joy yourself, or to share the grief of friends who grieve? The twofold sorrow, lady, is certainly the greater evil. Then we are ruined now, although the plague is past. What do you mean?  I do not understand what you say. That man, while afflicted, found joy for himself in the dire fantasies that held him, though his presence distressed us who were sane.  But now, since he has had pause and rest from the plague, he has been utterly subjected to lowly anguish, and we similarly grieve no less than before.  Surely, then, these are two sorrows, instead of one? Indeed, I agree, and so I fear that a blow sent by a god has hit him.  How could it be otherwise, if his spirit is no lighter than when he was plagued, now that he is released? This, you must know, is how matters stand. In what way did the plague first swoop down on him?  Tell us who share your pain how it happened. You will hear all that took place, since you are involved. In the dead of night when the evening lamps were no longer aflame, he seized a two-edged sword and wanted to leave on an aimless foray.  Then I admonished him and said, What happened out there, I cannot tell.  But he came in with his captives hobbled together—bulls, herding dogs, and his fleecy quarry.  Some he beheaded;  of some he cut the twisted throat or broke the spine;  others he abused in their bonds as though they were men, though falling only upon cattle.  At last he darted out through the door, and dragged up words to speak to some shadow—now against the Atreidae, now about Odysseus—with many a mocking boast of all the abuse that in vengeance he had fully repaid them during his raid. After that he rushed back again into the house, and somehow by slow, painful steps he regained his reason.  And as he scanned the room full of his disastrous madness, he struck his head and howled;  he fell down, a wreck amid the wrecked corpses of the slaughtered sheep, and there he sat with clenched nails tightly clutching his hair.  At first, and for a long while, he sat without a sound.  But then he threatened me with those dreadful threats, if I did not declare all that had happened, and he demanded to know what on earth was the business he found himself in. And in my fear, friends, I told him all that had been done, as far as I knew it for certain.  But he immediately groaned mournful groans, such as I had never heard from him before.  For he had always taught that such wailing was for cowardly and low-hearted men.  He used to grieve quietly without the sound of loud weeping, but instead moaned low like a bull. the man sits idly where he has fallen in the middle of the iron-slain cattle.  And plainly he plans to do something terrible.  Somehow his words and his laments say as much.  Ah, my friends—for it was my errand to ask you this—come in and help him, if in any way you can. Men of his kind can be won over by the words of friends. Tecmessa, daughter of Teleutas, terrible is your news that our lord has been possessed by his sorrows. Oh!  Ah, me! Ah, me! Soon there will be more sorrow, it seems.  Did you not hear Ajax, did you not hear his resounding howl? Oh!  Ah, me! Ah, me! The man seems to be sick, or else to be still pained by the disease which was recently with him, since he sees its traces. Oh my son, my son! Ah, miserable me!  Eurysaces, it is for you he calls!  What can his purpose be?  Where are you?  I am miserable! Teucer!  Where is Teucer?  Will his raid last for ever?  While I perish? He seems to be sane—open the door! Perhaps merely at the sight of me he will come to a more respectable mood. There, it is open. Now you can look on this man’s deeds, and his true condition. Ah, good sailors, you alone of my friends who alone still abide by the true bond of friendship, see how great a wave has just now crested over and broken around me, set on by a murderous storm! Ah, lady, too true, it seems, was your testimony! The fact proves that he is not sane. Ah, you clan staunch in maritime skill, who embarked and stroked the oar-blade upon the brine, in you, in you alone I see a defense against suffering.  Come, slay me on top of these! Hush!  Speak words of better omen!  Do not cure evil by prescribing evil; do not increase the anguish of your mad disaster. Do you see the bold, the strong of heart, the dauntless in battles with the enemy—do you see me now, terrible in the force of my hands against beasts unformidable?  Oh, the mockery!  How I have been violated! Ajax, my lord, I beg you, do not talk this way! Away with you!  Will you not take yourself outside! Ah, me!  Ah, me! By the gods I plead, give way and acquire good sense! My rotten fortune!—I let slip from my grasp those men who were begging for punishment, and fell instead on cattle with twisted horns and fine goats, making their dark blood flow! Why grieve when the deed is past recall?  These things can never be but as they are. Ah, you who spy out all things, you ready tool of  every crime, ah, son of It is at the god’s dispensation that every man both laughs and mourns. Yet if only I could see him, even shattered as I am! Oh!  Oh! Make no big threats!  Do you not see the trouble you are in? O Zeus, forefather of my forebears, if only I might destroy that deep dissembler, that hateful sneak, and the two brother-kings, and finally die myself, also! When you make that prayer, pray at the same time for me that I, too, may die.  What reason is there for me to live when you are dead? Ah, Darkness, my light! O Gloom of the underworld, to my eyes brightest-shining, take me, take me to dwell with you—yes, take me.  I am no longer worthy to look for help to the race of the gods, or for any good from men, creatures of a day. If my past achievements go to ruin, my friends, along with such victims as these near me, and if I am inclined to foolish plunderings, then with sword driven by both hands all the army would murder me! Ah, what misery for me that a valuable man should speak words of a sort which he would never before now have endured to speak! Ah!  You paths of the sounding sea, you tidal caves and wooded pastures by the shore, long, long, too long indeed have you detained me here at kindly to the Greeks, no more shall you look on Ajax, whose equal in the army—here I will boast—  In truth I do not know how to restrain you, nor how to let you speak further, when you have fallen on such harsh troubles. Aiai! Who would ever have thought that my name would so descriptively suit my troubles?\\n                        For well now may Ajax cry prowess won him the fairest prize of all the army, whose father brought every glory home from this same land of Ida;  but I, his son, who came after him to this same ground of I am ruined as you see by dishonor from the Greeks.  And yet of this much I feel sure:  if Achilles lived, and had been called to award the first place in valor to any claimant of his arms, no one would have grasped them before me. But now the Atreidae have made away with them to a man without scruples and thrust away the triumphs of Ajax.  And if these eyes and this warped mind had not swerved from the purpose that was mine, they would have never in this way procured votes in judgment against another man. As it was, the daughter of Zeus, the grim-eyed, unconquerable goddess, tripped me up at the instant when I was readying my hand against them, and shot me with a plague of frenzy so that I might bloody my hands in these grazers.  And those men exult to have escaped me— not that I wanted their escape.  But if a god sends harm, it is true that even the base man can elude the worthier. Shall I leave my station at the ships and the Atreidae to their own devices in order to go home across the for which he himself won a great crown of fame?  No, I could not bear to do it!  But then shall I go against the bulwark of the Trojans, attacking alone in single combats and doing some valuable service, and finally die?  But, in so doing I might, I think, gladden the Atreidae. That must not happen.  Some enterprise must be sought whereby I may prove to my aged father that in nature, at least, his son is not gutless.  It is a stain upon a man to crave the full term of life, when he finds no variation from his ignominious troubles. What joy is there in day following day, now advancing us towards, now drawing us back from the verge of death?  I would not buy at any price the man who feels the glow of empty hopes. The options for a noble man are only two:  either live with honor, or make a quick and honorable death.  You have heard all. No man shall say that you have spoken a bastard word, Ajax, or one not bred of your own heart.  Yet at least pause;  dismiss these thoughts, and grant friends the power to rule your purpose. Ajax, my lord, the fortune that humans are compelled to endure is their gravest evil.  I was the daughter of a free-born father mighty in wealth, if any Phrygian was.  Now I am a slave, for somehow the gods so ordained, and even more so did your strong hand.  Therefore, since I have come into your bed, I wish you well, and I do beg you, by the Zeus of our hearth, by your marriage-bed in which you coupled with me, do not condemn me to the cruel talk of your enemies, do not leave me to the hand of a stranger! On whatever day you die and\\n                        widow me by your death, on that same day, be sure, I shall also be seized\\n                        forcibly by the Greeks and, with your son, shall obtain a slave’s\\n                        portion. Then one of my masters will name me bitterly, shooting me with taunts: while the shame of these words will stain you and your family.  Show respect to your father, whom you abandon in miserable old age, and respect your mother with her share of many years, who often prays to the gods that you may come home alive. Pity, too, my king, your son.  Pity him the great sorrow which at your death you will bequeath both to him and to me, if robbed of nurturing care he must spend his days apart from you, an orphan tended by guardians who are neither family nor friends. save you, and you are the reason.  Your spear ravaged my country to nothingness, and another fate has brought down my mother and father, giving them a home in Hades in their death.  What homeland, then, could I have without you?  What wealth?  My welfare is entirely in your hands. So remember me, too.  A true man should cherish remembrance, if anywhere he takes some pleasure.  It is kindness that always begets kindness.  But whoever lets the memory of benefits seep from him, he can no longer be a noble man. Ajax, I wish that pity touched your heart as it does mine.  Then you would approve her words. She will have approval as far as I am concerned, if only she takes heart and graciously does my bidding. Dear Ajax, I will obey you in everything. Then bring me my son, so that I may see him. But in my fear I released him from my keeping. Because of these troubles of mine?  Or what do you mean? Yes, for fear that somehow the poor child would get in your way, and die. Yes, that would have been truly worthy of my destiny. Well, at least I took care to avert that disaster. I approve of your action and of your foresight. How, then, can I serve you, as things stand now? Let me speak to him and see him face to face. Oh, yes—he is close by, watched by our servants. Then why is his presence delayed? My child, your father calls you.  Bring him here, servant, whichever of you is guiding his steps. Is the man coming?  Or has he missed your call? Here now one of the servants approaches with him. Lift him; lift him up here. Doubtless he will not shrink to look on this newly-shed\\n                        blood, if he is indeed my true-born son and heir to his father’s manners.\\n                        But he must at once be broken into his father’s harsh ways and moulded to\\n                        the likeness of my nature. Ah, son, may you prove luckier than your father, but in all else like him.  Then you would not prove base.  Yet even now I may well envy you on this account, that you have no perception of these evils about us.  Yes, life is sweetest when one lacks sense, that is, until one learns to know joy or pain. But when you come to that knowledge, then\\n                        you must be sure to prove among your father’s enemies of what mettle and of\\n                        what lineage you are. Meanwhile feed on light breezes, and nurse your tender\\n                        life for your mother’s joy. There is no Greek—I know it for certain—who will do violence to you with hard outrages, even when you are without me.  So trusty is the guard, Teucer himself, whom I will leave at your gates.  He will not falter in his care for you, although now he walks a far path, busied with the hunt of enemies. O my warriors, my seafaring comrades!  On you as on him, I lay this shared task of love:  give my command to Teucer!  Let him take this child to my home and set him before the face of Telamon, and of my mother, Eriboea, so that he may become the comfort of their age into eternity Hold it and wield it by the sturdy thong, this sevenfold, spear-proof shield!  But the rest of my arms shall be my gravemates. Come, take the child right away, shut tight the doors and make no laments before the house. God, what a weepy thing is woman.  Quick, close the house!  It is not for a skilful doctor to moan incantations over a wound that craves the knife. I am afraid when I hear this eager haste. Your tongue’s sharp edge does not please\\n                        me. Ajax, my lord, what can you have in mind? Do not keep asking me, do not keep questioning.  Self-restraint is a virtue. Ah, how I despair!  Now, by your child, by the gods, I implore you, do not betray us! You annoy me too much.  Do you not know that I no longer owe any service to the gods? Hush, no impiety! Speak to those who hear. You will not listen? Already your words have been too many. Yes, because I am afraid, my king! Close the doors this instant! In the name of the gods, be softened! You have foolish hope, I think, if you plan so late to begin schooling my temper. O famous But I, miserable, have long been delayed here, still making my bed through countless months in the camp on the fields of Ida. I am worn by time and with anxious expectation still of a journey to Hades the abhorred, the unseen. And now a new struggle awaits me, ah, me!—a match with Ajax, hard to cure, sharing his tent with a madness of divine origin.  It is he whom mighty in bold war you dispatched from you once far in the past.  But now he is changed; he grazes his thoughts in isolated places and has been found a heavy sorrow for his friends. His hands’ former achievements, deeds\\n                        of prowess supreme, have fallen without friends, without friends, before the unfriendly, miserable Atreidae. Surely his mother, companion of antiquity and grey with age, when she hears that he has been afflicted with the ruin of his mind will\\n                        raise a loud cry of wailing. It is not the nightingale’s piteous lament that she, unhappy, will sing.  Rather in shrill-toned odes the dirge will rise, while the hollow sound of beating hands and the shredding of grey hair will fall upon her breast. Yes, better hid in Hades is the man plagued by foolishness, who by the lineage from where he springs is noblest of the enduring Achaeans, yet now is constant no more in his inbred temperament, but wanders outside himself.  O Telamon, unhappy father, how heavy a curse upon your son awaits your hearing, a curse which never yet has any life-portion of the heirs of Aeacus nourished but his! All things the long and countless years first draw from darkness, and then bury from light; and there is nothing which man should not expect:  the dread power of oath is conquered, as is unyielding will. For even I, who used to be so tremendously strong—yes, like tempered iron—felt my\\n                        tongue’s sharp edge emasculated by this woman’s words, and I feel the pity\\n                        of leaving her a widow and the boy an orphan among my enemies. the meadows by the shore so that by purging my defilements I may escape the heavy anger of the goddess.  Then I will find some isolated spot, and bury this sword of mine, most hateful weapon, digging down in the earth where none can see. Let Night and Hades keep it underground! For ever since I took into my hand this gift\\n                        from Hector, my greatest enemy, I have gotten no good from the Greeks. Yes,\\n                        men’s proverb is true: the gifts of enemies are no gifts and bring no good. submit to authority. So it is that winter with its snow-covered paths gives place to\\n                        fruitful summer; night’s dark orbit makes room for day with her white horses\\n                        to kindle her radiance; the blast of dreadful winds allows the groaning sea to rest;  and among them all, almighty Sleep releases the fettered sleeper, and does not hold him in a perpetual grasp. suits one who will in turn become a friend.  Similarly to a friend I would wish to give only so much help and service as suits him who will not forever remain friendly.  For the masses regard the haven of comradeship as treacherous. go inside and pray to the gods that the desires of my heart be completed to the very end. I am going to where my journey inexorably leads.  But you do as I say, and before long, perhaps, though I now suffer, you will hear that I have found rest and peace. I shiver with rapture; I soar on the wings of sudden joy! O Pan, O Pan, appear to us, sea-rover, from the stony ridge of snow-beaten Cyllene.  King, dancemaker for the gods, come, so that joining with us you may set on the Nysian and the Cnosian steps, your self-taught dances.  Now I want to dance.  And may Apollo, lord of and join me in his divine form, in eternal benevolence! Ares has dispelled the cloud of fierce trouble from our eyes.  Joy, joy!  Now, Zeus, now can the white radiance of prosperous days approach our swift, sea-speeding ships, since Ajax forgets his pain anew, and has instead fully performed all prescribed sacrifices to the gods with worship and strict observance. And so I would not say that anything was beyond belief, when beyond our hopes, Ajax has been converted from his fury and mighty struggles against the Atreidae. Friends, my first news is this: Teucer has just now returned from the Mysian heights. He has come to the generals’\\n                        quarters mid-camp, and is being shouted at by all the Greeks at once.\\n                        Recognizing him from a distance as he approached, they gathered around\\n                        him and then pelted him with jeers from every side—no one held back—calling him had been plucked from sheaths and were drawn in their hands.  But then the conflict, when it had nearly run its full course, was halted by the conciliatory words of the elders.  But where shall I find Ajax, to tell him this?  To our lord I must tell all. He is not inside, but is recently departed.  He has yoked a new purpose to his new mood. No!  Oh, no!  Too late, then, was he who sent me on this errand, or I myself came too slowly. What is this urgent matter? What part of it has been neglected? Teucer declared that Ajax should not slip out of the house, until he himself arrives. Well, he is departed, I repeat, bent on the purpose that is best for him—to be rid of his anger at the gods. These words betray great foolishness, if there is any wisdom in the prophecies of Calchas. What does he prophesy?  What knowledge of this affair do you bring? This much I know and witnessed on the spot.  Leaving the royal circle of the chiefs who sat in council, Calchas separated himself from the Atreidae and put his right hand with all kindness into the hand of Teucer.  The prophet then addressed him and strictly commanded him to use every possible resource to keep Ajax inside his tent for the duration of this day that now shines on us, and to prevent him from moving about if he wished ever to look on him alive. For this day alone will the anger of divine\\n                        Athena lash at him. That was the prophet’s warning. With those words the seer finished, and at once Teucer rose from his seat and sent me with these orders for you to follow.  But if I have been cheated of success, Ajax does not live.  Otherwise Calchas has no skill. Poor Tecmessa, born to misery, come out and see this man and his news.  The razor lies close at our throat, poised to cut off all joy. Why do you stir me from my place of rest, when I have just found peace from those relentless troubles? Listen to this man, and hear the news of Ajax that he has brought us—news at which I felt sudden grief. Oh, no, what is your news, man?  Surely we are not ruined? I have no clue of your condition, but know only that, if Ajax is away, I have little hope for him. But he is away, so  I am in agony to know what you mean. Teucer strictly commands that you keep Ajax under shelter of his tent and not allow him to go out alone. But where is Teucer?  And why these orders? He has just now returned, and he suspects that such a departure carries death for Ajax. Oh, misery!  From whom can he have learned this? From Thestor’s son, the prophet. His prophecy applies to today, when the issue is one of\\n                        life or death for Ajax. Ah, me! My friends, protect me from the doom threatened by fate! Hurry, some of you, to\\n                        speed Teucer’s coming; let others go to the westward bays, and others to the eastward, and there seek the man’s\\n                        disastrous path. I see now that I have been deceived by my husband and cast\\n                        out of the favor that I once had with him. Ah, my child, what shall I do? I\\n                        must not sit idle. I too will go as far as my strength will carry me.  Move, let us be quick, this is no time to sit still, if we wish to save a man who is eager for death. I am ready to help, and I will show it in more than word.  Speed of action and speed of foot will follow together. The sacrificial killer stands planted in the way that will cut most deeply—if I have the leisure for even this much reflection.  First, it is the gift of Hector, that enemy-friend who was most hateful to me and most hostile to my sight;  next, it is fixed in enemy soil, the land of newly-whetted on the iron-devouring stone;  and finally I have planted it with scrupulous care, so that it should prove most kind to me by a speedy death. It is no large prize that I ask you to award me.  Send on my behalf some messenger with news of my downfall to Teucer, so that he may be the first to raise me once I have fallen on this sword and made it newly-wet, and so that I am not first spotted by some enemy and cast out and exposed as prey to the dogs and birds.  For this much, Zeus, I appeal to you.  I call also on Hermes, guide to the underworld, to lay me softly to sleep with one quick, struggle-free leap, when I have broken open my side on this sword. And I call for help to the eternal maidens who eternally attend to all sufferings among mortals, the dread, far-striding Erinyes, asking them to learn how my miserable life is destroyed by the Atreidae. And may they seize those wicked men with most wicked destruction, just as they see me And you, Helios, whose chariot-wheels climb the steep sky, when you see the land of my fathers, draw in your rein spread with gold and tell my disasters and my fate to my aged father and to the unhappy woman who nursed me. Poor mother!  Indeed, I think, when she hears this news, she will sing a song of loud wailing throughout the entire city.  But it is not for me to weep in vain like this.  No, the deed must quickly have its beginning.  O Death, Death, come now and lay your eyes on me! And yet I will meet you also in that other world and there address you.  But you, beam of the present bright day, I salute you and the Sun in his chariot for the last time and never again.  O light!  O sacred soil of my own The rest he will tell to the shades in Hades. Toil follows toil yielding toil!  Where, where have I not trudged?  And still no place can say that I have shared its secret. Listen!  A sudden thud! We made it, we shipmates of your voyage. What news, then? All the westward flank of the ships has been scoured for tracks. And did you find anything? Only an abundance of toil.  There was nothing more to see. Neither, as a matter of fact, has the man been seen along the path that faces the shafts of the morning sun. Who, then, can guide me?  What toiling fisherman, busy about his sleepless hunt, what nymph of the Olympian heights or of the streams that flow toward  but fail to see where the enfeebled man is. Ah, me, ah, me! Whose cry broke from that nearby grove? Ah, misery! There, I see his unfortunate young bride, who was the prize of his spear, Tecmessa, dissolved in that pitiful wailing. I am lost, destroyed, razed to the ground, my friends! What is it? Here is our Ajax—his blood newly shed, he lies folded around the sword, burying it. Ah, no!  Our homecoming is lost!  Ah, my king, you have killed me, the comrade of your voyage!  Unhappy man—broken-hearted woman! His condition demands that we cry But by whose hand can the ill-fated man have contrived this end? He did it with his own hand;  it is obvious. This sword which he planted in the ground and on which he fell convicts him. Ah, what blind folly I have displayed!  All alone, then, you bled, unguarded by your friends!  And I took no care, so entirely dull was I, so totally stupid.  Where, where lies inflexible Ajax, whose name means anguish? No, he is not to be looked at!  I will cover him over entirely with this enfolding shroud, since no one—no one, that is, who loves him—could bear to see him spurt the darkened gore of his self-inflicted slaughter up his nostrils and out of the bloody gash. Ah, what shall I do?  What loved one is there to lift you in his arms?  Where is Teucer?  How timely would be his arrival, if he would but come to compose the corpse of his brother here!  Ah, unlucky Ajax, from so great a height you are fallen so low! Even among your enemies you are worthy of mourning! You were bound, poor man, with that unbending heart you were bound, it seems, to fulfill a harsh destiny of limitless toils!  So wild to my ears were the words of hatred which in your fierce mood you moaned against the Atreidae with such deadly passion.  True it is that that moment was a potent source of sorrows, when the arms were made the prize for a contest in the skills of warfare! Ah!  Ah! True anguish, I know, pierces your heart. Ah!  Ah, me! I do not wonder, lady, that you wail and wail again, when you have just lost one so loved. It is for you to analyze my troubles, but for me to feel them too fully. I must agree. Oh, my son, to what a heavy yoke of slavery we advance!  What cruel task-masters stand over us! Ah, the deeds of the two ruthless Atreidae which you name in our present grief would be unthinkable!  May the gods hold them back! These events that you see would not have happened as they have without the will of the gods. Yes, they have brought upon us a burden too heavy to bear. Yet what suffering the divine daughter of Zeus, fierce Pallas, engenders for Odysseus’\\n                        sake! No doubt the much-enduring hero exults in his dark soul and mocks in loud laughter at these frenzied sorrows—what shame!— and with him, when they hear the news, will laugh the royal brothers, the Atreidae. Then let them mock and rejoice at this man’s misery. Perhaps, even though they did not\\n                        cherish him while he lived, they will lament his death, when they meet with\\n                        the difficulties of war. Men of crooked judgment do not know what good they have in their hands until they have thrown it away.  His death is more bitter to me than it is sweet to the Greeks;  but in any case to Ajax himself it is a joy, since he has accomplished all that he desired to get—his longed-for death.  So why should they exult over him? He died before the gods, not at all before them—no!  And so let Odysseus toss his insults in empty glee.  For them Ajax is no more;  for me he is gone, abandoning me to anguish and mourning. Ah!  Ah, no! Quiet—I think I hear the voice of Teucer striking a note that points to this disaster. Beloved Ajax, brother whose face was so dear to me, have you truly fared as the mighty rumor says? He is dead, Teucer.  Take it as fact. Then I am destroyed by my heavy fortune! When things stand as they do— Ah, misery, misery! —you have cause to mourn. O rash passion! Yes, Teucer, far too rash. Ah, misery—what about the man’s child? Where in all of He is alone near the tent. Then bring him here right away, so that we may prevent some enemy from snatching him away, as a hunter snatches a cub from a lioness and leaves her barren!   Go quickly; give me your help!  It is the habit of men everywhere to laugh in triumph over the dead when they are mere corpses on the ground. Yes, while still alive, Teucer, Ajax ordered you to care for the child, just as you are in fact doing. This sight is truly most painful to me of all that my eyes have seen. And the journey truly loathsome to my heart above all other journeys is this one that I have just now made while pursuing and scouting out your footsteps, dearest Ajax, once I learned of your fate!  For a swift rumor about you, as if sent from some god, passed throughout all the Greek army, telling that you were dead and gone. I heard the rumor while still far away from you, and I groaned quietly in sadness.  But now that I see its truth, my heart is utterly shattered!  Oh, god! what a full crop of sorrows you have sown for me in your death!  Where can I go?  What people will receive me, when I have failed to help you in your troubles?  No doubt Telamon, your father and mine, will likely greet me with a smile and kind words, when I return without you. Yes, of course he will—a man who, even when enjoying good\\n                        fortune, tends not to smile more brightly than before! What will a man like\\n                        him leave unsaid? What insult will he forego against or better yet, your branded by his taunts as a slave instead of a freeman.  These are my prospects at home.  At off the sharp tooth of this gleaming sword, the murderer who, it seems, made you breathe your last?  Now do you see how in time Hector, though dead, was to destroy you? First Hector with the very warrior’s belt given to him by Ajax was lashed to the\\n                        chariot-rail and shredded without end, until his life fled with his breath.\\n                        Now Ajax here had this gift from Hector, and by this he has perished in his\\n                        deadly fall. Was it not the Fury who forged this blade, was not that belt the product of Hades, the grim artificer?  I, for my part, would affirm that these happenings and all happenings ever are designed by the gods for men.  But if there is anyone in whose judgment my words are unacceptable, let him cherish his own thoughts, as I do mine. Do not go on at length, but consider how you will bury him and what you will next say.  For I see our enemy approaching, and chances are that he comes to mock at our sorrows, like one who would do us harm. What man of the army do you see? Menelaus, the beneficiary of this expedition. I see him; he is not hard to recognize when near. You there, I tell you not to lift that corpse for burial, but leave it where it lies. Why do you waste your breath on this arrogant command? It conveys my decree, and the decree of the army’s supreme ruler. Would you mind, then, telling me what reason you pretend? This—that when we had hoped we were bringing Ajax from home to be an ally and a friend for the Greeks, we found him on closer examination to be an enemy worse than the Phrygians, since he plotted the murder of the entire army and marched by night against us in order to take us with his spear.  And if some god had not smothered this attempt, we would have been allotted the fate which he now has, and we would be dead and lie prostrate by an ignoble doom, while he would be living.  But now a god has turned his outrage aside, so that it fell on the sheep and cattle. to become forage for the birds of the seashore. So then do not inflame the terrible force of your spirit.  If we were unable to master him while he lived, in any case in death, at least, we shall rule him despite your opposition and control him by force of our hands.   For while he lived, there never was a time when he would obey my commands. nor can a camp be ruled any more with moderation, if it lacks the guarding force of fear and reverence.  A man, though he grow his body great and mighty, must expect to fall, even from a light blow.  Whoever knows fear and shame both, you can be certain that he has found his salvation;  but where there is license to attack others and act at will, do not doubt that such a State, though she has run before a favoring wind, will eventually sink with time into the depths. let us not think that we can act on our desires without paying the price in pain.  These things come by turns.  He was once the hot attacker, now it is my hour to glory.  And so I warn you not to bury him, so that you can avoid falling into your own grave. Menelaus, after laying down wise precepts, do not then violate the dead. Never again, my fellow Salaminians, will I be amazed if some nobody by birth does wrong, when those who are reputed to be born of noble blood employ such wrongful sentiments in their arguments. On what grounds are you his commander? On what grounds have you a right to kingship over\\n                        the men whom he brought from home? It was as You sailed here under the command of others, not as a supreme commander who might at any time exercise authority over Ajax. in the grave as justice demands, and I will not fear your tongue. It was not at all for\\n                        your wife’s sake that Ajax made this expedition, as did those toil-worn\\n                        drudges. No, it was for the sake of the oath by which he had sworn, and not\\n                        at all for you, since it was not his habit to value nobodies. And so when you come here again, bring more heralds, and the leader of the expedition, too.  Your bluster could not make me turn to notice you, so long as you are what you are. Again, I say, in these troubles I cannot approve of such a tone.  Harsh words sting, however just they are. The bowman seems to feel no little grandeur. I do, since it is no lowly skill that I possess. How you would boast, if you had a shield! Even without a shield I would be a match for you fully armed. What a tongue you have!  What dreadful anger it feeds! When right is with him, a man’s thoughts may be grand. What, is it right that the man who murdered me should prosper? Murdered you?  It is truly a strange happening, if in fact you live after being killed. A god rescued me.  So far as that corpse is concerned, I am in Hades. Then since it was the gods who saved you, do not dishonor the gods. What, would I find fault with divine law? Yes, if by your presence here you prevent burial of the dead. Prevent it I do, since he was at war with me and I with him.  Burial in such a case would not be right. What do you mean?  Did Ajax ever stand forth publicly to war with you? He hated me as I hated him, and you knew it, too. Yes, he hated you because you had been caught fixing the votes in order to rob him. At the hands of the jurymen, not mine, he suffered that loss. You could make a thousand stealthy crimes look pretty. That sentiment leads to pain for someone I know. The pain will be no greater, I think, than that which we will inflict. I will tell you once and for all—there is to be no burial for him. And hear my reply—he shall be buried immediately. Once I saw a bold-tongued man who had urged sailors to set sail during wintertime.  Yet in him you could have found no voice when the worst of the storm was upon him.  No, hidden beneath his cloak he allowed the crew to trample on him at will.  And so it is with you and your raging speech—perhaps a great storm, even if its blast comes from a small cloud, will extinguish your shouting. Yes, and I have seen a man stuffed with foolishness who exulted in his neighbor’s\\n                        misfortunes. It turned out that a man like me and of similar temperament\\n                        stared at him and said, I will go—it would be a disgrace to have it known that I argue when I have the power to use force. Leave then! The worst disgrace for me is that I should listen to a fool’s empty\\n                        chatter. A trial of this great discord will soon come about.  But you, Teucer, with all the speed you can muster, be quick to seek a hollow grave for Ajax, where he shall establish his dank tomb, a constant memorial for mortals. And now just in time his son and his wife approach to arrange the burial of the pitiable corpse.  Come here, nephew.  Take your place near him, and  grasp in supplication your father, your begetter.  Kneel and pray for help, with locks of hair in your hand from me, her, and thirdly you; they are the suppliant’s only resource. But if any soldier from the army should tear you\\n                        by violence from this body, then for his wickedness may he be wickedly cast\\n                        out of his country and get no burial, but be severed at the root with all\\n                        his race, just as I shear this lock. Take it, Nephew, and keep it safe.  Let no one move you, but kneel there and cling to the dead. Which will be the last year?  When will the sum of the years of our many wanderings stop bringing upon me the unending doom of toilful spear-battles throughout broad If only that man had first passed into the depths of the sky or into Hades, the common home of all, before he taught the Greeks the shared plague of Ares’ detested arms! Ah, those toils of\\n                        his invention, which produced so many more toils! Look how that man has\\n                        ravaged humanity! No delight in garlands or deep wine-cups did that man provide me, no sweet din of flutes, that miserable man, or pleasing rest in the night. And from love—god!—from love he has totally barred me. Here I lie uncared for, while heavy dews constantly wet my hair, damp reminders of joyless In the past bold Ajax was always my bulwark against night’s terrors and flying missiles.\\n                        But now he has become an offering consecrated to a malignant divinity.  What joy, then, what delight awaits me anymore? O to be where the wooded wave-washed cape fences off the deep sea, to be beneath Sunium’s jutting plateau, so that we might salute sacred Here I am!  I hurried back when I saw the supreme commander, Agamemnon, rapidly approaching. It is plain to me that he will let his clumsy tongue fly. So it is you, they tell me, who dared open your mouth wide to make fierce threats\\n                        against us—and are you still unpunished? Yes, I mean you—you, the captive\\n                        slave’s son. No doubt if you were born from a noble mother, your talk would reach the sky and you would proudly strut about, when now it is the case that, though you are a nobody and a nothing, you have stood up for this other nothing lying here, and have vowed that we came out with no authority either as admirals or as generals to rule the Greeks or you.  No, as an autonomous ruler, you say, Ajax set sail. Does it not shame me that I hear these proud words from slavish mouths?  What was the man whom you shout about with such arrogance?  Where did he advance, or where did he stand his ground, where I did not do the same?  Have the Greeks, then, no other men but him?  To our own harm, it seems, we announced to the Greeks the contests for the arms of Achilles, if on all sides we are accounted corrupt because of Teucer, and if it will never satisfy you Salaminians, even when you are defeated, to accept the verdict which satisfied the majority of the judges.  But instead you will always no doubt aim your slanderous arrows at us, or treacherously lash at our backs when you fall behind us in the race. These tendencies must be checked. It is not the stout, broad-shouldered men that are the steadiest allies.  No, it is the wise who prevail in every engagement.  A broad-backed ox is kept straight on the road all the same when only a small whip directs him. And a dose of this very medicine, I foresee, will find you before long, unless you gain a little good sense.  He no longer exists, but is already a shade, yet still you boldly insult us and give your tongue too much freedom.  Restrain yourself, I say.  Recall your birth, your nature. Bring someone else here—a man who is freeborn—who can plead your cause before me in your place.  For when you speak, I no longer understand— I do not know your barbarian language. If only you both had the sense to exercise self-restraint! There is no better advice that I could give you two. My, how quickly gratitude to the dead seeps away from men and is found to have turned to betrayal, since this man no longer offers even the slightest praise in remembrance of you, Ajax, even though it was for his sake you toiled so often in battle, offering your own life to the spear!  No, your assistance is dead and gone, all flung aside! when you were all but destroyed in the turn of the battle and he, he alone came and\\n                        saved you at the moment when the flames were already blazing around the\\n                        decks at your ships’ sterns and Hector was leaping high over the trench\\n                        towards the vessels? Who averted that? Was it not Ajax who did it, the one who, you say, nowhere set foot\\n                        where you were not? Well, do you grant that he did his duty to you there?\\n                        And what about when another time, all alone, he confronted Hector in single\\n                        combat according to the fall of the lots, and not at anyone’s command? The lot which he cast in was not the kind to flee the challenge;  it was no lump of moist earth, but one which would be the first to leap lightly from the crested helmet!  It was this man who did those deeds, and I, the slave, the son of the barbarian mother, was at his side. Lord Odysseus, you arrive at the right time, if mediation, not division, is your purpose in coming. What is the trouble, friends? From far off I heard shouting from the Atreidae over this\\n                        brave man’s corpse. Is it not because we, Lord Odysseus, have long had to hear the worst, most shameful language from this man? How so?  I can pardon a man a retaliatory barrage of abuse if another has insulted him. I insulted him, since his conduct toward me was of the same stripe. And what did he do that harmed you? He declares that he will not leave this corpse without due burial, but will entomb it in spite of me. Then may a friend speak the truth, and still remain your helpmate no less than before? Speak.  Otherwise I would be less than sane, since I count you my greatest friend among all the Greeks. Listen, then.  In the name of the gods, do not let yourself so ruthlessly cast this man out unburied.  Do not in any way let the violence of your hatred overcome you so much that you trample justice under foot. To me, too, this man was once the most\\n                        hostile enemy in the army from the day on which I beat him for possession of\\n                        Achilles’ arms. Yet for all that he was hostile towards me, I would not\\n                        dishonor him in return or refuse to admit that in all our Greek force at in doing him harm, not even if you hate him. You, Odysseus—do you champion him against me in this battle? I do, though I did hate him, when it was honorable for me to hate. But should you not also trample him now that he is dead? Do not take delight, son of Atreus, in that superiority which brings no honor. Reverence, I tell you, is not easily practiced by the autocrat. But it is easy to grant dispensations to friends when they advise well. A good man should listen to those in charge. Stop!  Your power is victorious when you surrender to your friends. Remember to what sort of man you show this kindness! The man was once my enemy, yes, but he was also noble. Why do you do this? Why do you so respect an enemy’s corpse? I yield to his excellence much more than his hostility. Men who act as you do are the unstable sort in humankind. Quite the majority of men, I assure you, are friendly at one time, and bitter at another. So then, are these the type of friends that you recommend we make? It is not my habit to recommend an inflexible spirit. You will make us appear to be cowards today. On the contrary, we will be men of justice in the eyes of all the Greeks. Then do you truly urge me to allow the burying of the dead? Yes, for I too shall come to that necessity. How true it is that in all things alike each man works for himself! And for whom should I work more than for myself? It must be called your doing then, not mine. However you do it, in all respects you will at least prove beneficent. In any case, be quite certain that to you I would grant a larger favor than this.   To that man, however, as on earth, so below I give my hatred.  But you can do what you will. Whoever denies, Odysseus, that you were born wise in judgment is a total fool since you have shown it just now. And now I announce that from this point on I am ready to be Teucer’s friend as much as I\\n                        was once his enemy. And I would like to join in the burying of your dead and\\n                        share your labors, omitting no service which mortals should render to their best and bravest warriors. Good Odysseus, I have only praise for your words.  You have greatly belied my fears.  Of all the Greeks you were his deadliest enemy, and yet you alone have stood by him with helping hand and did not come here and allow yourself in life to violate the dead Ajax ruthlessly, as did the crazed general who came, since he and his brother wanted to cast out the outraged corpse without burial.  Therefore may the Father supreme on and the unforgetting Fury and Justice the Fulfiller destroy them for their wickedness with wicked deaths, just as they sought to cast this man out with unmerited, outrageous mistreatment. lest I so offend the dead.  In all other tasks do indeed be our partner.  And if you wish to bring any soldier of the army with you, he shall be welcome.  For the rest, I will make all things ready.  But you, Odysseus, know that to us you have been a good and noble friend. It was my wish to help, but if it is not pleasing to you that I should assist here, I accept your decision and depart. Enough.  Already the interval has been long drawn out.  Come, hurry some of you to dig the hollow grave; others erect the cauldron wrapped in fire on its high stand for prompt preparation of the ritual cleansing.  Let another company bring from the tent the finery which he wore in battle beneath his shield.  And you, too, child, with such strength as you have lay a loving hand upon your father and help me to lighten his body;  for his channels are still warm and spray upwards the dark force of his spirit. laboring in service to this man of perfect excellence.  To a nobler man such service has never yet been rendered Many things, I tell you, can be known through mortal eyes;  but before he sees it happening, no one can foretell the future, or what his fate will be.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                            O city of Thebes, I Andromache, envied name in days of yore, but now of all women hurled from the towering battlements, when the Hellenes sacked our Trojan home; and I myself am come to Hellas as a slave, though I was esteemed a daughter of a race most free, given to Neoptolemus that island-prince, and set apart for him as his special prize from the spoils of Troy. And here I dwell upon the boundaries of Phthia and Pharsalia’s town, where Thetis erst, the goddess of the sea, abode with Peleus apart from the world, avoiding the throng of men; wherefore the folk of Thessaly call it the sacred place of Thetis, in honour of the goddess’s marriage. Here dwells the son of Achilles and suffers Peleus still to rule Pharsalia, not wishing to assume the sceptre while the old man lives. Within these halls have I born a boy to the son of Achilles, my master. Now aforetime for all my misery I ever had a hope to lead me on, that, if my child were safe, I might find some help and protection from my woes; but in scorn of his bondmaid’s charms, I am tormented by her most cruelly; for she saith that I by secret enchantment am making her barren and distasteful to her husband, and that I design to take her place in this house, ousting her the rightful mistress by force; whereas I at first submitted against my will and now have resigned my place; be almighty Zeus my witness that But I cannot convince her, and she longs to kill me, and her father Menelaus is an accomplice in this. E’en now is he within, arrived from Sparta for this very purpose, while I in terror am come to take up a position here in the shrine of Thetis adjoining the house, if haply it may save me from death; for Peleus and his descendants hold it in honour as a symbol of his marriage with the Nereid. My only son am I secretly conveying to a neighbour’s house in fear for his life. For his sire stands not by my side to lend his aid and cannot avail his child at all, being absent in the land of Delphi, where he is offering recompense to Loxias for the madness he committed, when on a day he went to Pytho and demanded of Phoebus satisfaction and win for him the god’s goodwill hereafter. Mistress mine, be sure I do not hesitate to call thee by that name, seeing that I thought it thy right in thine own house also, when we dwelt in Troy-land: as I was ever thy friend and thy husband’s while yet he was alive, so now have I come with strange tidings, in terror lest any of our masters learn hereof but still out of pity for thee; for Menelaus and his daughter are forming dire plots against thee, whereof thou must beware. Ah! kind companion of my bondage, for such thou art to her, who, erst thy queen, is now sunk in misery; what are they doing? What new schemes are they devising in their eagerness to take away my wretched life? Alas! poor lady, they intend to slay thy son, whom thou hast privily conveyed from out the house. Ah me! Has she I know not, but thus much of their schemes I heard myself; and Menelaus has left the house to fetch him. Then am I lost; ah, my child! those vultures twain will take and slay thee; while he who is called thy father lingers still in Delphi. True, for had he been here thou wouldst not have fared so hardly, I am sure; but, as it is, thou art friendless. Have no tidings come of the possible arrival of Peleus? He is too old to help thee if he came. And yet I sent for him more than once. Surely thou dost not suppose that any of thy messengers heed thee? Why should they? Wilt thou then go for me? How shall I explain my long absence from the house? Thou art a woman; thou canst invent a hundred ways. There is a risk, for Hermione keeps no careless guard. Dost look to that? Thou art disowning thy friends in distress. Not so; never taunt me with that. I will go, for woman and a slave is not of much account, e’en if aught befall, me. Go then, while I will tell to heaven the lengthy tale of lamentation, mourning, and weeping, that has ever been my hard lot; for ’tis woman’s way to delight in present misfortunes even to keeping them always on her tongue and lips. But I have many reasons, not merely one for tears,–my city’s fall, my Hector’s death, the hardness of the lot to which I am bound, since I fell on slavery’s evil days undeservedly. ’Tis never right to call a son of man happy, till thou hast seen his end, to judge from the way he passes it how he will descend to that other world. ’Twas no bride Paris took with him to the towers of Ilium, but a curse to his bed when he brought Helen to her bower. For her sake, O Troy, did eager warriors, sailing from Hellas in a thousand ships, capture and make thee a prey to fire and sword; and the son of sea-born Thetis mounted on his chariot dragged my husband Hector round the walls, ah woe is me! while I was hurried from my chamber to the beach, with slavery’s hateful pall upon me. And many a tear I shed as I left my city, my bridal bower, and my husband in the dust. Woe, woe is me! why should I prolong my life, to serve Hermione? Her cruelty it is that drives me hither to the image of the goddess to throw my suppliant arms about it, melting to tears as doth a spring that gushes from the rock. Lady, thus keeping thy weary station without pause upon the floor of Thetis’ shrine, Phthian though I am, to thee a daughter of Asia I come, to see if I can devise some remedy for these perplexing troubles, which have involved thee and Hermione in fell discord, because to thy sorrow thou sharest with her the love of Achilles’ son. Recognize thy position, weigh the present evil into the which thou art come. Thou art a Trojan captive; thy rival is thy mistress, a true-born daughter of Sparta. Leave this home of sacrifice, the shrine of our sea-goddess. How can it avail thee to waste thy comeliness and disfigure it by weeping by reason of a mistress’s harsh usage? Might will prevail against thee; why vainly toil in thy feebleness? Come, quit the bright sanctuary of the Nereid divine. Recognize that thou art in bondage on a foreign soil, in a strange city, where thou seest none of all thy friends, luckless lady, cast on evil days. Yea, I did pity thee most truly, Trojan dame, when thou earnest to this house; but from fear of my mistress I hold my peace, albeit I sympathize with thee, lest she, whom Zeus’s daughter bore, discover With a crown of golden workmanship upon my head and about my body this embroidered robe am I come hither; no presents these I wear from the palace of Achilles or Peleus, but gifts my father Menelaus gave me together with a sumptuous dower from Sparta in Laconia, to insure me freedom of speech. Such is my answer to you but as for thee, slave and captive, thou wouldst fain oust me and secure this palace for thyself, and thanks to thy enchantment I am hated by my husband; thou it is that hast made my womb barren and cheated my hopes; for Asia’s daughters have clever heads for such villainy; yet will I check thee therefrom, nor shall this temple of the Nereid avail thee aught, no! neither its altar or shrine, but thou shalt die. But if or god or man should haply wish to save thee, thou must atone for thy proud thoughts of happier days now past by humbling thyself and crouching prostrate at my knees, by sweeping out my halls, and by learning, as thou sprinklest water from a golden ewer, where thou now art. Here is no Hector, no Priam with his gold, but a city of Hellas. Yet thou, miserable woman, hast gone so far in wantonness that thou canst lay thee down with the son of the very man that slew thy husband, and bear children to sister and brother mate together; the nearest and dearest stain their path with each others blood, and no law restrains such horrors. Bring not these crimes amongst us, for here we count it shame that one man should have the control of two wives, and men are content to turn their attention to one lawful love, that is, all who care to live an honourable life. Women are by nature Ah! well-a-day! Youth is a bane to mortals, in every case, that is, where a man embraces injustice in his early days. Now I am afraid that my being a slave will prevent thee listening to me in spite of many a just plea, or if I win my case, I fear I may be damaged on this very ground, for the high and mighty cannot brook refuting arguments from their inferiors; still I will not be convicted of betraying my own cause. Tell me, proud young wife, what assurance can make me confident of wresting from thee thy lawful lord? Is it that Laconias capital yields to Phrygia? is it that my fortune outstrips thine? or that in me thou seest a free woman? Am I so elated by my youth, my full healthy figure, the extent of my city, the number of my friends that I wish to supplant thee in thy home? Is my purpose to take thy place and rear myself a race of slaves, mere appendages to my misery? or, supposing thou bear no children, will any one endure that sons of mine should rule oer Phthia? Ah no! there is the love that Hellas bears me, both for Hectors sake and for my own humble rank forsooth, that never knew a queens estate in Troy. ’Tis not my sorcery that makes thy husband hate thee, nay, but thy own failure to prove thyself his help-meet. is no doubt a mighty fact, yet thou findest no place for his Scyros, displaying wealth ’midst poverty and setting Menelaus above Achilles: and that is what alienates thy lord. Take heed; for a woman, though bestowed upon a worthless husband, must be with him content, and ne’er advance presumptuous claims. Suppose thou hadst wedded a prince of Thrace, the land of flood and melting snow, where one lord shares his affections with a host of wives, wouldst thou have slain them? If so, thou wouldst have set a stigma of insatiate lust on all our sex. A shameful charge! And yet herein we suffer more than men, though we make a good stand against it. Ah! my dear lord Hector, for thy sake would I e’en brook a rival, if ever Cypris led thee astray, and oft in days gone by I held thy bastard babes to my own breast, to spare thee any cause for grief. By this course I bound my husband to me by virtue’s chains, whereas thou wilt never so much as let the drops of dew from heaven above settle on thy lord, in thy jealous fear. Oh! seek not to surpass thy mother in hankering after men, for ’tis well that all wise children should avoid the habits of such evil mothers. Mistress mine, be persuaded to come to terms with her, as far as readily comes within thy power. Why this haughty tone, this bandying of words, as if, forsooth, thou, not I, wert the virtuous wife? Thy present claims at any rate give thee small title thereto. Woman, may my bosom never harbour such ideas as thine! Thou art young to speak on so delicate a subject. As for thee, thou dost not speak thereof but, as thou canst, dost put it into action against me. Canst thou not conceal thy pangs of jealousy? What! doth not every woman put this first of all? Yes, if her experiences are happy; otherwise, there is no honour in speaking of them. Barbarians’ laws are not a standard for our city. Alike in Asia and in Hellas infamy attends base actions. Clever, clever quibbler! yet die thou must and shalt. Dost see the image of Thetis with her eye upon thee? A bitter foe to thy country because of the death of Achilles. ’Twas not I that slew him, but Helen that mother of thine. Pray, is it thy intention to probe my wounds yet deeper? Behold, I am dumb, my lips are closed. Tell me that which was my only reason for coming hither. No! all I tell thee is, thou hast less wisdom than thou needest. Wilt thou leave these hallowed precincts of the sea-goddess? Yes, if I am not to die for it; otherwise, I never will. Since that is thy resolve, I shall not even wait my lord’s return. Nor yet will I, at any rate ere that, surrender to thee. I will bring fire to bear on thee, and pay no heed to thy entreaties. Kindle thy blaze then; the gods will witness it. And make thy flesh to writhe by cruel wounds. Begin thy butchery, stain the altar of the goddess with blood, for she will visit thy iniquity. Barbarian creature, hardened in impudence, wilt thou brave death itself? Still will I find speedy means to make thee quit this seat of thy free-will; such a bait have I to lure thee with. But I will hide my meaning, which the event itself shall soon declare. Yes, keep thy seat, for I will make thee rise, though molten lead is holding thee there, before Achilles’ son, thy trusted champion, arrive. My trusted champion, yes! how strange it is, that, though some god hath devised cures for mortals against the venom of reptiles, no man ever yet hath discovered aught to cure a woman’s venom, which is far worse than viper’s sting or scorching flame; so terrible a curse are we to mankind. Ah! what sorrows did the son of Zeus and Maia herald, in the day he came to Ida’s glen, guiding that fair young trio of goddesses, all girded for the fray in bitter rivalry about their beauty, to the shepherd’s fold, where dwelt the youthful herdsman all alone by the hearth of his lonely hut. Soon as they reached the wooded glen, in gushing mountain springs they bathed sweet-sounding words, but fraught with ruthless overthrow to Phrygia’s hapless town and Ilium’s towers. Would God his mother had smitten him a cruel death-blow slopes, in the hour Cassandra, standing by the holy bay-tree, cried out, for the babe’s destruction. Ah! had they listened, she suffered during Behold I bring thy son with me, whom thou didst steal away to a neighbour’s house without my daughter’s knowledge. Thou wert so sure this image of the goddess would protect thee and those who hid him, but thou hast not proved clever enough for Menelaus. And so if thou refuse to leave thy station here, he shall be slain instead of thee. Wherefore weigh it well: wilt die thyself, or see him slain for the sin whereof thou art guilty against me and my daughter? O fame, fame! full many a man ere now of no account hast thou to high estate exalted. Those, indeed, who truly have a fair repute, I count blest; but those who get it by false pretences, I will never allow have aught but the accidental appearance of wisdom. Thou for instance, caitiff that thou art, didst thou ever wrest Troy from Priam with thy picked troops of Hellenes? thou that hast raised such a storm, at the word of thy daughter, a mere child, and hast entered the lists with a poor captive; unworthy I count thee of Troy’s capture, and Troy still more disgraced by thy victory. Those who only in appearance are men of sense make an outward show, but inwardly resemble the common herd, save it be in wealth, which is their chiefest strength. Come now, Menelaus, let us discuss this argument. yet can she never escape the pollution of murder, and public opinion will make thee too an accomplice in this deed of blood, for thy share in the business must needs implicate thee. But even supposing I escape death myself, will ye kill my child? Even then, how will his father brook the murder of his child? Troy has no such coward’s tale to tell of him; nay, he will follow duty’s call; his actions will prove him a worthy scion of Peleus and Achilles. Thy daughter will he thrust forth from his house; and what wilt thou say when seeking to betroth her to another? wilt say her virtue made her leave a worthless lord? Nay, that will be false. Who then will wed her? wilt thou keep her without a husband in thy halls, grown grey in widowhood? Unhappy wretch! dost not see the flood-gates of trouble opening wide for thee? How many a wrong against a wife wouldst thou prefer thy daughter to have found to suffering what I now describe? We ought not on trifling grounds to promote serious mischief; nor should men, if we women are so deadly a curse, bring their nature down to our level. No! if, as thy daughter asserts, I am practising sorcery against her and making her barren, right willingly will I, without any crouching at altars, submit in my own person to the penalty that lies in her husband’s hands, seeing that I am no less chargeable with injuring him if I make him childless. This is my case; but for thee, there is one thing Thou hast said too much for a woman speaking to Woman, these are petty matters, unworthy, as thou sayest, of my despotic sway, unworthy too of Hellas. Yet mark this well; his special fancy of the hour is of more moment to a man than Troy’s capture. I then have set myself to help my daughter because I consider her loss of a wife’s rights a grave matter; for whatever else a woman suffers is secondary to this; if she loses her husband’s love she loses her life therewith. Now, as it is right Neoptolemus should rule my slaves, so my friends and I should have control of his; for friends, if they be really friends, keep nothing to themselves, but have all in common. So if I wait for the absent instead of making the best arrangement I can at once of my affairs, I show weakness, not wisdom. Arise then, leave the goddess’s shrine, for by thy death this child escapeth his, whereas, if thou refuse to die, I will slay him; for one of you twain must perish. Ah me! ’tis a bitter lot thou art offering about my life; whether I take it or not I am equally unfortunate. Attend to me, thou who for a trifling cause art committing an awful crime. Why art thou bent on slaying me? What reason hast thou? What city have I betrayed? Which of thy children was ever slain by me? What house have I fired? I was forced to be my master’s concubine; and spite of that wilt thou slay me, not him who is to blame, passing by the cause and hurrying to the inevitable result? Ah me! my sorrows! Woe for my hapless country! How cruel my fate! Why had I to be a mother too and take upon me a double load of suffering? Yet why do I mourn the past, and o’er the present never shed and Ilium, piteous sight! one sheet of flame, while I was haled away by the hair of my head to the Argive ships in I slavery, and on my arrival in Phthia was assigned to Hector’s murderer as his mistress. What pleasure then has life for me? Whither am I to turn my gaze? to the present or the past? My babe alone was left me, the light of my life; and him these ministers of death would slay. No! they shall not, if my poor life can save him; for if he be saved, hope in him lives on, while to ’twere shame to refuse to die for my son. Lo! here I leave the altar and give myself into your hands, to cut or stab, to bind or hang. Ah! my child, to Hades now thy mother passes to save thy dear life. Yet if thou escape thy doom, remember me, my sufferings and my death, and tell thy father how I fared, with fond caress and streaming eye and arms thrown round his neck. Ah! yes, his children are to every man as his own soul; and though he suffers less anguish, yet tastes the bitter in his cup of bliss. Thy tale with pity fills me; for every man alike, stranger though he be, feels pity for another’s distress. Menelaus, ’tis thy duty to reconcile thy daughter and this captive, giving her a respite from sorrow. Ho! sirrahs, catch me this woman; hold her fast; for ’tis no welcome story she will have to hear. It was to make thee leave the holy altar of the goddess that I held thy child’s death before thy eyes, and so induced thee to give thyself up to me to die. So stands thy case, be well assured; but as for this child, my daughter shall decide Alas! thou hast by treachery beguiled me; I was deceived. Proclaim it to the world; I do not deny it Is this counted cleverness amongst you who dwell by the Eurotas? Yes, and amongst Trojans too, that those who suffer should retaliate. Thinkest thou God’s hand is shortened, and that thou wilt not be punished? Whene’er that comes, I am ready to bear it. But thy life will I have. Wilt likewise slay this tender chick, whom thou hast snatched from ’neath my wing? Not I, but I will give him to my daughter to slay if she will. Ah me! why not begin my mourning then for thee, my child? Of a truth ’tis no very sure hope that he has left. O citizens of Sparta, the bane of all the race of men, schemers of guile, and masters in lying, devisers of evil plots, with crooked minds and tortuous methods and ne’er one honest thought, ’tis wrong that ye should thrive in Hellas. What crime is wanting in your list? How rife is murder with you! How covetous ye are! One word upon your lips, another in your heart, this is what men always find with you. Perdition catch ye! Still death is not so grievous, as in the day that hapless Troy was destroyed with my lord, that glorious warrior, whose spear oft made a coward like thee quit the field and seek thy ship. But now against a woman hast thou my tongue shall never flatter thee or that daughter of thine. For though thou wert of great account in Sparta, why so was I in Troy. And if I am now in sorry plight, presume not thou on this; thou too mayst be so yet. Never, oh! never will I commend rival wives or sons he shareth with no other. Not even in states is dual monarchy better to bear than undivided rule; it only doubles burdens and causes faction amongst the citizens. Often too will the Muse sow strife ’twixt rivals Again, when strong winds are drifting mariners, the divided counsel of the wise is not conducive to steering, and their collective wisdom has less weight than the inferior intelligence of the single man who has sole authority; This Spartan, the daughter of the great chief Menelaus, proves this; for she hath kindled hot fury against a rival, and is bent on slaying the hapless Trojan maid and her child to further her bitter quarrel. Tis a murder gods and laws and kindness all forbid. Ah! lady, retribution for this deed will visit thee yet. But lo! before the house I see those two united souls, condemned to die. Alas! for thee, poor lady, and for thee, unhappy child, who art dying on account of thy mother’s marriage, though thou hast no share therein and canst not be blamed by the royal house. Behold me journeying on the downward path, my hands so tightly bound with cords that they bleed. O mother, mother mine! I too share thy downward path, nestling ’neath thy wing. A cruel sacrifice! ye rulers of Phthia! Come, father! succour those thou lovest. Rest Ah, woe is me! what will become of me and thee too, mother mine? Away, to the world below! from hostile towers ye came, the pair of you; two different causes necessitate your deaths; my sentence takes away thy life, and my daughter Hermione’s requires his; for it would be the height of folly to leave our foemen’s sons, when we might kill them and remove the danger from our house. O husband mine! I would I had thy strong arm and spear to aid me, son of Priam. Ah, woe is me! what spell can I now find to turn death’s stroke aside? Embrace thy master’s knees, my child, and pray to him. Spare, O spare my life, kind master! Mine eyes are wet with tears, which trickle down my cheeks, as doth a sunless spring from a smooth rock. Ah me! What remedy, alas! can I provide me ’gainst my ills? Why fall at my knees in supplication? hard as the rock and deaf as the wave am I. My own friends have I helped, but for thee have I no tie of affection; for verily it cost me a great part of my life to capture Troy and thy mother; so thou shalt reap the fruit thereof and into Hades’ halls descend. Behold! I see Peleus drawing nigh; with aged step he hasteth hither.  Menelaus, hold thy hand. Seek not to outrun justice. will I breathe new life into this captive, being to her as the breeze that blows a ship before the wind. Tell me, by what right have they pinioned thine arms and are dragging thee and thy child away? like a ewe with her lamb art thou led to the slaughter, while I and thy lord were far away. Behold them that are haling me and my child to death, e’en as thou seest, aged prince. Why should I tell thee? For not by one urgent summons alone but by countless messengers have I sent for thee. No doubt thou knowest by hearsay of the strife in this house with this man’s daughter, and the reason of my ruin. So now they have torn and are dragging me from the altar of Thetis, the goddess of thy chiefest adoration and the mother of thy gallant son, without any proper trial, yea, and without waiting for my absent master; because, forsooth, they knew my defencelessness and my child’s, whom they mean to slay with me his hapless mother, though he has done no harm. But to thee, O sire, I make my supplication, prostrate at thy knees, though my hand cannot touch thy friendly beard; save me, I adjure thee, reverend sir, or to thy shame and my sorrow shall we be slain. Loose her bonds, I say, ere some one rue it; untie her folded hands. I forbid it, for besides I have a far better right to her. What! art thou come hither to set my house in order? Art not content with ruling thy Spartans? She is my captive; I took her from Troy. Aye, but my son’s son received her as his prize. Is not all I have his, and all his mine? For good, but not evil ends; and surely not for murderous violence. Never shalt thou wrest her from my grasp. With this good staff I’ll stain thy head with blood! Just touch me and see! Approach one step! What! shalt thou rank with men? chief of cowards, son of cowards! What right hast thou to any place ’mongst men? Thou who didst let a Phrygian rob thee of thy wife, leaving thy home without bolt or guard, No! a Spartan! maid could not be chaste, e’en if she would, who leaves her home and bares her limbs and lets her robe float free, to share; with youths their races and their sports,-- customs I cannot away with. Is it any wonder then that ye fail to educate your women in virtue? Helen might have asked thee this, seeing that she said goodbye to thy affection and tripped off with her young gallant to a foreign land. And yet for her sake thou didst marshal all the hosts of Hellas and lead them to Ilium, whereas thou shouldst have shown thy loathing for her by refusing to stir a spear, once thou hadst found her false; yea, thou shouldst have let her stay there, and even paid a price to save ever having her back again. But that was not at all the way thy thoughts were turned; wherefore many a brave life hast thou ended, and many an aged mother hast thou left childless in her home, and grey-haired sires of gallant sons hast reft. Of that sad band am I a member, Achilles murderer like a malignant fiend; for thou and thou alone hast returned from Troy without a scratch, bringing back thy splendid weapons in their splendid cases just as they went. As for me, I ever told that amorous boy to form no alliance with thee nor take unto his home an evil mother’s child; for daughters bear the marks of their mothers’ ill-repute into their new homes. Wherefore, ye wooers, take heed to this my warning: bidding him sacrifice his daughter in his simpleness! So fearful wast thou of losing thy worthless wife. Then after capturing Troy,–for thither too will I accompany thee,–thou didst not slay that woman, when she was in thy power; but as soon as thine eyes caught sight of her breast, thy sword was dropped and thou didst take her kisses, fondling the shameless traitress, too weak to stem thy hot desire, thou caitiff wretch! Yet spite of all thou art the man to come and work havoc in my grandson’s halls when he is absent, seeking to slay with all indignity a poor weak woman and her babe; but that babe shall one day make thee and thy daughter in thy home rue it, e’en though his birth be trebly base. Yea, for oft ere now hath seed, sown on barren soil, prevailed o’er rich deep tilth, and many a bastard has proved a better man than children better born. Take thy daughter hence with thee! Far better is it for mortals to have a poor honest man either as married kin or friend than a wealthy knave; but as for thee, thou art a thing of naught. The tongue from trifling causes contrives to breed great strife ’mongst men; wherefore are the wise most careful not to bring about a quarrel with their friends. Why, though thou shouldst have banished her far for But I, after all this foresight for thee, old man, and myself, am to have her torn from my clutches for wishing to slay her. Yet come now, for there is no disgrace in arguing the matter out; suppose my daughter has no child, while this woman’s sons grow up, wilt thou set them up to rule the land of Phthia, barbarians born and bred to lord it over Hellenes? Am I then so void of sense because I hate injustice, and thou so full of cleverness? Consider wouldst thou have sat looking on in silence? I trow not. Dost thou then for a foreigner rail thus at thy nearest friends? Again, thou mayst say, husband and wife have an equally strong case if she is wronged by him, and similarly if he find her guilty of indiscretion in his house; yet while he has ample powers in his own hands, she depends on parents and friends for her case. Surely then I am right in helping my own kin! Thou art in thy dotage; for thou wilt do me more, good by speaking of my generalship than by concealing it. Helen’s trouble was not of her own choosing, but sent by I showed my wisdom in refraining from slaying my wife, directly I caught sight of her. Would that thou too hadst ne’er slain Phocus! All this I bring before thee in pure good-will, not from anger. But if thou resent it, thy tongue may wag till it ache, yet shall I gain by prudent forethought. Cease now from idle words, ’twere better far, for fear ye both alike go wrong. Alas! what evil customs now prevail in Hellas! Whene’er the host sets up a trophy o’er the foe, men no more consider this the work of those who really toiled, but the general gets the credit for it. Now he was but one among ten thousand others to brandish his spear; he only did the work of one; but yet he wins more praise than they. Again, as magistrates in all the grandeur of office they scorn the common folk, though they are naught themselves; whereas those others are ten thousand times more wise than they, if daring combine with judgment. Even so thou and thy brother, now take your seats in all the swollen pride of Trojan fame and Trojan generalship, exalted by the toilsome efforts of others. will hale through his halls by the hair of her head; for her barrenness will not let her endure fruitfulness in others, because she has no children herself. Still if she is unlucky in the matter of offspring, is that a reason why we should be left childless? Begone! ye varlets, let her go! I will soon see if anyone will hinder me from loosing her hands.  Didst think thou wert lashing up a lion or bull? or wert afraid she would snatch a sword and defend herself against thee? Come, child, nestle to thy mother’s arms; help me loose her bonds; I will yet rear thee in Phthia to be their bitter foe. If your reputation for prowess and the battles ye have fought were taken from you Spartans, in all else, be very sure, you have not your inferiors. The race of old men practises no restraint; and their testiness makes it hard to check them. Thou art only too ready to rush into abuse; while, as for me, I came to Phthia by constraint and have therefore no intention either of doing or suffering anything mean. Now must I return home, for I have no time to waste; for there is a city not so very far from Sparta, which aforetime was friendly but now is hostile; against her will I march with my army and bring her into subjection. And when I have arranged that matter as I wish, I will return; and face to face with my son-in-law I will give my version of the story and hear his. And if he punish her, and for the future she exercise self-control, she shall find me do the like; but if he storm, I’ll storm as well; and for, like to a shadow as thou art, Lead on, my child, safe beneath my sheltering Heaven reward thee and all thy race, old sire, for having saved my child and me his hapless mother! Only beware lest they fall upon us twain in some lonely spot upon the road and force me from thee, when they see thy age, my weakness, and this child’s tender years; take heed to this, that we be not a second time made captive, after escaping now. Forbear such words, prompted by a woman’s cowardice. Go on thy way; who will lay a finger on you? Methinks he will do it to his cost. For by heaven’s grace I rule o’er many a knight and spearman bold in my kingdom of Phthia; yea, and myself can still stand straight, no bent old man as thou dost think; such a fellow as that a mere look from me will put to flight in spite of my years. For e’en an old man, be he brave, is worth a host of raw youths; for what avails a fine figure if a man is a coward? Oh! to have never been born, or sprung from noble sires, the heir to mansions richly stored; for if aught untoward e’er befall, there is no lack of champions for sons of noble parents, and there is honour and glory for them when they are proclaimed scions of illustrious lines; time detracts not from the legacy these good men leave, but the light of their goodness still burns on when they are dead. Better is it not to win a discreditable victory, than to make justice miscarry by an invidious exercise of power; for such a victory, though men think it sweet for the moment, grows barren in time and comes very near being a family reproach. This is the life I commend, this the life. I set before me as my ideal, to exercise no authority beyond what is right either in the marriage-chamber or in the state. O aged son of Aeacus! now am I sure that thou wert with the Lapithae, wielding thy famous spear, when they fought the Centaurs; on her voyage of note; and when in days long gone the son of Zeus spread slaughter round Troy’s famous town, thou too didst share his triumphant return to Europe. Alas! good friends, what a succession of troubles is to-day provided us! My mistress Hermione within the house, deserted by her father and in remorse for her monstrous deed in plotting the death of Andromache and her child, is bent on dying; for she is afraid her husband will in requital for this expel her with dishonour from his house or put her to death, because she tried to slay the innocent. And the servants that watch her can scarce restrain her efforts to hang herself, scarce catch the sword and wrest it from her hand. So bitter is her anguish, and she hath recognized the villainy of her former deeds. As for me, friends, I am weary of keeping my mistress from the fatal noose; do ye go in and try to save her life; for if strangers come, they prove more persuasive than the friends of every day. Ah yes! I hear an outcry in the house amongst the servants, confirming the news thou hast brought. Poor sufferer! she seems about to show a lively grief for her grave crimes; for she has escaped her servants’ hands and is rushing from the house, eager to end her life.  My child, what wilt thou do? Wilt thou disfigure thyself? Ah me! ah me! Begone, thou fine-spun veil! float from my head away! Daughter, cover up thy bosom, fasten thy robe. Why should I cover it? My crimes against my lord are manifest and clear, they cannot be hidden. Art so grieved at having devised thy rival’s death? Indeed I am; I deeply mourn my fatal deeds of daring; alas! I am now accursed in all men’s eyes! Thy husband will pardon thee this error. Oh! why didst thou hunt me to snatch away my sword? Give, oh! give it back, dear nurse, that I may thrust it through my heart. Why dost thou prevent me hanging myself? What! was I to let thy madness lead thee on to death? Ah me, my destiny! Where can I find some friendly fire? To what rocky height can I climb above the sea or ’mid some wooded mountain glen, there to die and trouble but the dead? Why vex thyself thus? on all of us sooner or later heaven’s visitation comes. Thou hast left me, O my father, left me like a stranded bark, all alone, without an oar. My lord will surely slay me; no home is mine henceforth beneath my husband’s roof. What god is there to whose statue I can as a suppliant haste? or shall I throw myself in slavish wise at slavish knees? Would I could speed the first that ever sailed betwixt the rocks Cyanean! My child, I can as little praise thy previous sinful excesses, committed against the Trojan captive, as thy present exaggerated terror. Thy husband will never listen to a barbarian’s weak pleading and reject his marriage with thee for this. For thou wast no captive from Troy whom he wedded, but the daughter of a gallant sire, with a rich dower, from a city too of no mean prosperity. Nor will thy father forsake thee, as thou dreadest, and allow thee to be cast out from this house. Nay, enter now, nor show thyself before Lo! a stranger of foreign appearance from some other land comes hurrying towards us. Ladies of this foreign land! is this the home, the palace of Achilles’ son? Thou hast it; but who art thou to ask such a question? The son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, by name Orestes, on my way to the oracle of Zeus at Dodona. But now that I am come to Phthia, I am resolved to inquire about my kinswoman, Hermione of Sparta; is she alive and well? for though she dwells in a land far from my own, I love her none the less. Son of Agamemnon, thy appearing is as a haven from the storm to sailors; by thy knees I pray, have pity on me in my distress, on me of whose fortunes thou art inquiring. About thy knees I twine my arms with all the force of sacred fillets. Ha! what is this? Am I mistaken or do I really see before me the queen of this palace, the daughter of Menelaus? The same, that only child whom Helen, daughter of Tyndareus, bore my father in his halls; never doubt that. O saviour Phoebus, grant us respite from our woe! But what is the matter? art thou afflicted by gods or men? Partly by myself, partly by the man who wedded me, and partly by some god. On every side I see ruin. Why, what misfortune could happen to a woman as yet childless, unless her honour is concerned? My very complaint! Thou hast hit my case exactly. On whom has thy husband set his affections in thy stead? On his captive, Hector’s wife. An evil case indeed, for a man to have two wives! ’Tis even thus. So I resented it. Didst thou with woman’s craft devise a plot against thy rival? Yes, to slay her and her bastard child. And didst thou slay them, or did something happen to rescue them from thee? It was old Peleus, who showed regard to the weaker side. Hadst thou any accomplice in this attempted murder? My father came from Sparta for this very purpose. And was he after all defeated by that old man’s prowess ? Oh no! but by shame; and he hath gone and left me all alone. I understand; thou art afraid of thy husband for that thou hast done. Thou hast guessed it; for he will have a right to me. What can I say for myself? Yet I beseech thee by Zeus the god of our family, send me to a land as far as possible from this, or to my father’s house; for these very and all the land of Phthia bates me. But if my lord return ere that from the oracle of Phoebus, he will put me to death on a shameful charge, or enslave me to his mistress, whom I ruled before. Maybe I was ruined by mischievous women who came to me and puffed me up with words like these: I had all I wanted, wealth in plenty, a house in which I was mistress, and as for children, mine would be born in wedlock, while hers would be bastards, half-slaves to mine. Oh! never, never,–this truth will I repeat,–should men of sense, who have wives, allow women-folk to visit them in their homes, for they teach them mischief; one, to gain some private end, helps to corrupt their honour; another, having made a slip herself, wants a companion in misfortune, while many are wantons; and hence it is men’s houses are tainted. Wherefore keep strict guard upon the portals of your houses with bolts and bars; for these visits of strange women lead to no good result, but a world of mischief. Thou hast given thy tongue too free a rein regarding thy own sex. I can pardon thee in this case, but still women ought to smooth over their sisters’ weaknesses. ’Twas sage counsel he gave who taught men to hear the arguments on both sides. I, for instance, though aware of the confusion in this house, the quarrel between thee and Hector’s wife, waited awhile and watched to see whether thou wouldst stay here or from fear of that captive art minded to quit these halls. Now it was not so much regard for thy message that brought me hither, as the intention of carrying thee away from this house, if, as now, thou shouldst grant me a chance of saying so. For thou wert mine formerly, but art now living with thy present husband through thy father’s baseness; since he, before invading Troy’s domains, betrothed thee to me, and then to thy present lord, provided he captured the city of Troy. So, as soon as Achilles’ son returned hither, I forgave thy a wife, I said, from amongst friends, but outside their circle ’twas no easy task for one exiled like myself from home. Thereat he grew abusive, taunting me with my mother’s murder and those blood-boltered fiends. and though ’tis true, I grieved, yet did I endure my sorrow, and reluctantly departed, robbed of thy promised hand. Now therefore, since thou findest thy fortune so abruptly changed and art fallen thus on evil days and hast no help, I will take thee hence and place thee in thy father’s hands. For kinship As for my marriage, my father must look to it; ’tis not for me to decide that. Yes, take me hence as soon as may be, lest my husband come back to his house before I am gone, or Peleus hear that I am deserting his son’s abode and pursue me on horse-back. Rest easy about the old man’s power; and, as for Achilles’ son with all his insolence to me, never fear him; such a crafty net this hand hath woven and set for his death with knots that none can loose; whereof I will not speak before the time, but, when my plot begins to work, Delphi’s rock will witness it. If but my allies in the Pythian land abide by their oaths, this same murderer of his mother will show that no one else shall marry thee my rightful bride. No! he shall perish O Phoebus! who didst fence the hill of Ilium with a fair coronal of towers, and thou, ocean-god! coursing o’er the main with thy dark steeds, wherefore did ye hand over in dishonour your own handiwork to the war-god, master of the spear, abandoning Troy to wretchedness? Many a well-horsed car ye yoked on the banks of Simois, and many a bloody tournament did ye ordain with never a prize to win; and Ilium’s princes are dead and gone; no longer in Troy is seen the blaze of fire on altars of the gods with the smoke of incense. The son of Atreus is no more, slain by the hand of his wife, and she herself hath paid the debt of blood by death, and from her children’s hands received her doom. The god’s own bidding from his oracle was levelled against her, in the day that Agamemnon’s son set forth from Argos and visited his shrine; so he slew Anon wherever Hellenes gather, was heard the voice of lamentation, mothers weeping o’er their children’s fate, as they left their homes to mate with strangers. Ah! thou art not the only one, nor thy dear ones either, on whom the cloud of grief hath fallen. Hellas had to bear the visitation, and thence the scourge crossed to Phrygia’s fruitful fields, raining the bloody drops the; death-god loves. Ye dames of Phthia, answer my questions. I heard a vague rumour that the daughter of Menelaus had left these halls and fled; so now am I come in hot haste to learn if this be true; for it is the duty of those who are at home to labour in the interests of their absent friends. Thou hast heard aright, O Peleus; ill would it become me to hide the evil case in which I now find myself; our queen has fled and left these halls. What was she afraid of? explain that to me. She was fearful her lord would cast her out In return Yea, and she was afraid of yon captive. With whom did she leave the house? with her father? The son of Agamemnon came and took her hence. What view hath he to further Yes, and he is plotting thy grandson’s death. From an ambuscade, or meeting him fairly face to face? In the holy place of Loxias, leagued with Delphians. God help us! This is an immediate danger. Hasten one of you with all speed to the Pythian altar and tell our friends there what has happened here, ere Achilles’ son be slain by his enemies. Woe worth the day! what evil tidings have I brought for thee, old sire, and for all who love my master! woe is me! Alas! my prophetic soul hath a presentiment. Aged Peleus, hearken! Thy grandson is no more; so grievously is he smitten by the men of Delphi and the stranger Ah! what wilt thou do, old man? Fall not; uplift thyself. I am a thing of naught; death is come upon me. My voice is choked, my limbs droop beneath me. Hearken; if thou art eager also lift up thyself and hear what happened. Ah, destiny! how tightly hast thou caught me in thy toils, a poor old man at life’s extremest verge! But tell me how he was taken from me, my one son’s only child; unwelcome as such news is, I fain would hear it. As soon as we reached the famous soil of Phoebus, for three whole days were we feasting our eyes with the sight. And this, it seems, caused suspicion; for the folk, who dwell near the god’s shrine, began to collect in groups, while Agamemnon’s son, going to and fro through the town, would whisper in each man’s ear malignant hints: But we, knowing naught as yet of this, took sheep fed in the pastures of Parnassus, and went our way and stationed ourselves at the altars with vouchers and Pythian seers. And one said: suggesting that my master was lying and had come on a shameful errand. But he crosses the threshold of the temple to pray to Phoebus before his oracle, in the cover of the bay- trees, and Clytemnestra’s son, that had contrived the whole But he stepped back, for it was not a mortal wound he had received, and drew his sword, and snatching armour from the pegs where it hung on a pillar, took his stand upon the altar-steps, the picture of a warrior grim; then cried he to the sons of Delphi, and asked them: covered and terrible was the war-dance thou hadst then seen thy grandson dance to avoid their marksmanship. At last, when they were hemming him in on all sides, allowing him no breathing space, he left the shelter of the altar, the hearth where victims are placed, and with one bound was on them as on the Trojans of yore; and they turned and fled like doves when they see the hawk. Many fell in the confusion; some wounded, and others trodden down by one another along the narrow passages; and in that hushed holy house uprose unholy din and echoed back from the rocks. Calm and still my master stood there in his gleaming harness like a flash of light, till from the inmost shrine there came a voice of thrilling horror, stirring the crowd to make a stand. Then fell Achilles’ son, smitten through the flank by some Delphian’s biting blade, some fellow that slew him with a host to help; and as he fell, there once so fair, was marred with savage wounds. At last they cast the lifeless clay, lying near the altar, forth from the fragrant fane. And we gathered up his remains forthwith and are bringing them to thee, old prince, to mourn and weep and honour with a deep-dug tomb. This is how that prince who vouchsafeth oracles to others, that judge of what is right for all the world, hath revenged himself on Achilles’ son, remembering his ancient quarrel as a wicked man would. How then can he be wise? Lo! E’en now our prince is being carried on a bier from Delphi’s land unto his home. Woe for him and his sad fate, and woe for thee, old sire! for this is not the welcome thou wouldst give Achilles’ son, the lion’s whelp; thyself too Ah! woe is me! here is a sad sight for me to see and take unto my halls! Ah me! ah me! I am undone, thou city of Thessaly! My line now ends; I have no children left me in my home. Oh! the sorrows I seem born to endure! What friend can I look to for relief? Ah, dear lips, and cheeks, and hands! Would thy destiny had slain thee ’neath Ilium’s walls beside the banks of Simois! Had he so died, my aged lord, he had won him honour thereby, and thine had been the happier lot. O marriage, marriage, woe to thee! thou bane of my home, thou destroyer fraught with the great god Phoebus with aiming that murderous shaft that spilt thy hero-fathers blood! Woe! woe! alas! With due observance of funeral rites will I begin the mourning for my dead master. Alack and well-a-day! I take up the tearful dirge, ah me! old and wretched as I am. ’Tis Heaven’s decree; God willed this heavy stroke. O darling child, thou hast left me all alone in my halls, Thou shouldst have died, old sire, before thy children. Shall I not tear my hair, and smite upon my head with grievous blows? O city! of both my children What evils thou hast suffered, what sorrows thou hast seen, thou poor old man! what shall be thy life hereafter? Childless, desolate, with no limit to my grief, I must drain the cup of woe, until I die. ’Twas all in vain the gods wished thee joy on thy wedding day. All my hopes have flown away, fallen short of my high boasts. A lonely dweller in a lonely home art thou. I have no city any longer; shalt see me grovelling in the dust, Look, look! of Phthia, home of steeds. O Peleus! because of my wedded days with thee now long agone, I Thetis am come from the halls of Nereus. And first I counsel thee not to grieve to excess in thy present distress, for I too who need ne’er have born children to my sorrow, have lost the child of our love, Achilles swift of foot, foremost of the sons of Hellas. Next will I declare why I am come, and do thou give ear. Carry yonder corpse, Achilles’ son, to the Pythian altar and there bury it, a reproach to Delphi, that his tomb may proclaim the violent death he met at the hand of Orestes. And for his captive wife Andromache,–she must dwell in the Molossian land, united in honourable wedlock with Helenus, and with her this babe, the sole survivor as he is of all the line of Aeacus, for from him a succession of prosperous kings of Molossia is to go on unbroken; for the race that springs from thee and me, my aged lord, must not thus be brought to naught; no! nor Troy’s line either; for her fate release from all the ills that flesh is heir to and make a deity to know not death nor decay. From henceforth in the halls of Nereus shalt thou dwell with me, and see Achilles, our dear son, settled in his island-home by the strand of Leuce, that is girdled by the Euxine sea. But get thee to Delphi’s god-built town, carrying this corpse with thee, and, after thou hast buried him, return and settle in the cave which time hath hollowed in the Sepian rock and there abide, till from the sea I come with choir of fifty Nereids to be thy escort thence; for fate’s decree thou must fulfil; such is the pleasure of Zeus. Cease then to mourn the dead; this is the lot which heaven assigns to all, and all must pay their debt to death. Great queen, my honoured wife, from Nereus sprung, all hail! thou art acting herein as befits thyself and thy children. So I will stay my grief at thy bidding, goddess, and, when I have buried the dead, will seek the glens of Pelion, even the place where I took thy beauteous form to my embrace. Surely after this every prudent man will seek to marry a wife of noble stock and give his daughter to a husband good and true, never setting his heart on a worthless woman, not even though she bring a sumptuous dowry to his house. So would men ne’er suffer ill at heaven’s hand. Many are the shapes of Heaven’s denizens, and many a thing they bring to pass contrary to our expectation; that which we thought would be is not accomplished, while for the unexpected God finds out a way. E’en such hath been the issue of this matter.  \n",
      "3   Ismene, my sister, true child of my own mother, do you know any evil out\\n                            of all the evils bequeathed by Oedipus that Zeus will not fulfil for the\\n                            two of us in our lifetime? There is nothing—no pain, no ruin, no shame, nor dishonor—that I have not\\n                            seen in your sufferings and mine. And now what is this new edict that\\n                            they say the general has just decreed to all the city? Do you know\\n                            anything? Have you heard? Or does it escape you that evils from our enemies are on the march against\\n                            our friends? To me no word of our friends, Antigone, either bringing joy or bringing\\n                            pain has come since we two were robbed of our two brothers who died in\\n                            one day by a double blow. And since\\n                            the I knew it well, so I was trying to bring you outside the courtyard gates\\n                            to this end, that you alone might hear. Hear what? It is clear that you are\\n                            brooding on some dark news. Why not? Has not Creon destined our brothers, the one to honored burial,\\n                            the other to unburied shame? Eteocles, they say, with due observance of\\n                            right and custom, he has laid in the earth for his honor among the dead below. As for the poor\\n                            corpse of Polyneices, however, they say that an edict has been published\\n                            to the townsmen that no one shall bury him or mourn him, but instead\\n                            leave him unwept, unentombed, for the birds a pleasing store as they look to satisfy their hunger.\\n                            Such, it is said, is the edict that the good Creon has laid down for you\\n                            and for me—yes, for me—and it is said that he is coming here to proclaim\\n                            it for the certain knowledge of those who do not already know. They say\\n                            that he does not conduct this business lightly, but whoever performs any of these rites, for him the\\n                            fate appointed is death by public stoning among the entire city. This is\\n                            how things stand for you, and so you will soon show your nature, whether\\n                            you are noble-minded, or the corrupt daughter of a noble line. Poor sister, if things have come to this, what would I profit by loosening or tightening this knot? Consider whether you will share the toil and the task. What are you hazarding? What do you intend? Will you join your hand to mine in order to lift his corpse? You plan to bury him—when it is forbidden to the city? Yes, he is my brother, and yours\\n                            too, even if you wish it otherwise. I will never be convicted of\\n                            betraying him. Hard girl! Even when Creon has forbidden it? No, he has no right to keep me from my own. Ah, no! Think, sister, how our father perished in hatred and infamy, when, because of the crimes that he\\n                            himself detected, he smashed both his eyes with self-blinding hand; then\\n                            his mother-wife, two names in one, with a twisted noose destroyed her\\n                                life; lastly, our two brothers\\n                            in a single day, both unhappy murderers of their own flesh and blood,\\n                            worked with mutual hands their common doom. And now we, in turn—we two\\n                            who have been left all alone—consider how much more miserably we will be\\n                            destroyed, if in defiance of the law we transgress against an autocrat’s decree or his powers.\\n                            No, we must remember, first, that ours is a woman’s nature, and\\n                            accordingly not suited to battles against men; and next, that we are\\n                            ruled by the more powerful, so that we must obey in these things and in\\n                            things even more stinging. I, therefore, will\\n                            ask those below for pardon, since I am forced to this, and will obey\\n                            those who have come to authority. It is foolish to do what is\\n                            fruitless. I would not encourage you—no, nor, even if you were willing\\n                                later, would I welcome you as\\n                            my partner in this action. No, be the sort that pleases you. I will bury\\n                            him—it would honor me to die while doing that. I shall rest with him,\\n                            loved one with loved one, a pious criminal. For the time is\\n                                greater that I must serve the\\n                            dead than the living, since in that world I will rest forever. But if\\n                            you so choose, continue to dishonor what the gods in honor have\\n                            established. I do them no dishonor. But to act in violation of the\\n                            citizens’ will—of that I am by nature incapable. You can make that your pretext!\\n                            Regardless, I will go now to heap a tomb over the brother I love. Oh no, unhappy sister! I fear for you! Do not tremble for me. Straighten out your own destiny. Then at least disclose the deed to no one before you do it. Conceal it, instead, in secrecy—and so,\\n                            too, will I. Go on! Denounce it! You will be far more hated for your silence, if you\\n                            fail to proclaim these things to everyone. You have a hot heart for chilling deeds. I know that I please those whom I am most bound to please. Yes, if you will also have the\\n                            power. But you crave the impossible. Why then, when my strength fails, I will have finished. An impossible hunt should not be tried in the first place. If you mean that, you will have my hatred, and you will be subject to\\n                            punishment as the enemy of the dead. But leave me and the foolish plan I have authored to suffer this\\n                            terrible thing, for I will not suffer anything so terrible that my death\\n                            will lack honor. Go, then, if you so decide. And of this be sure: though your path is foolish, to your loved ones your love is straight and true. Shaft of the sun, fairest light of all that have dawned\\n                                on You have goaded with a sharper bit the\\n                            warrior of the white shield, who came from He set out against our land\\n                            because of the strife-filled claims of Polyneices, and like a screaming\\n                            eagle he flew over into our land, covered by his snow-white\\n                                wing, with a mass of weapons\\n                            and crested helmets. He paused above our dwellings; he\\n                            gaped around our sevenfold portals with spears thirsting for blood; but\\n                            he left before his jaws were ever glutted with our gore, or\\n                                before the Fire-god’s pine-fed flame had seized our crown of towers. So\\n                            fierce was the crash of battle swelling about his back, a match too hard\\n                            to win for the rival of the dragon. For Zeus detests above all the\\n                            boasts of a proud tongue. And when he saw them advancing in a swollen\\n                                flood, arrogant their clanging\\n                            gold, he dashed with brandished fire one who was already starting to\\n                            shout victory when he had reached our ramparts. Staggered, he fell to the earth\\n                            with a crash, torch in hand, a man\\n                            possessed by the frenzy of the mad attack, who just now was raging\\n                            against us with the blasts of his tempestuous hate. But his threats did\\n                            not fare as he had hoped, and to the other enemies mighty Ares dispensed\\n                            each their own dooms with hard blows, Ares, our mighty ally at the turning-point. For the seven captains, stationed\\n                            against an equal number at the seven gates, left behind their brazen\\n                            arms in tribute to Zeus the turner of battle—all but the accursed pair\\n                            who, born of one father and one mother, set against each other their spears, both victorious, and who\\n                            now share in a common death. But since Victory whose name is\\n                            glory has come to us, smiling in joy equal to the joy of chariot-rich let us make for ourselves forgetfulness after\\n                            the recent wars, and visit all the temples of the gods with night-long\\n                            dance and song. And may Bacchus, who shakes the earth of But look, the king of the land is\\n                            coming here, Creon, the son of Menoeceus, our new ruler in accordance\\n                            with the new circumstances fated by the gods. What policy is he setting\\n                            in motion, that he has proposed\\n                            this special conference of elders, and summoned it by a general\\n                            mandate? My fellow citizens! First, the\\n                            gods, after tossing the fate of our city on wild waves, have once more\\n                            righted it. Second, I have ordered you through my messengers to come\\n                                here apart from all the rest,\\n                            because I knew, first of all, how constant was your reverence for the\\n                            power of the throne of Laius; how, again, you were reverent, when\\n                            Oedipus was guiding our city; and lastly, how, when he was dead, you\\n                            still maintained loyal thoughts towards his children. Since, then, these latter have fallen in one day by a\\n                            twofold doom—each striking, each struck, both with the stain of a\\n                            brother’s murder—I now possess all the power and the throne according to\\n                            my kinship with the dead. Now, it is impossible to know fully any man’s character,\\n                            will, or judgment, until he has been proved by the test of rule and\\n                            law-giving. For if anyone who directs the entire city does not cling to\\n                            the best and wisest plans, but because of some\\n                            fear keeps his lips locked, then, in my judgment, he is and has long\\n                            been the most cowardly traitor. And if any man thinks a friend more\\n                            important than his fatherland, that man, I say, is of no account. Zeus,\\n                            god who sees all things always, be my witness— I would not be silent if I saw ruin, instead of safety,\\n                            marching upon the citizens. Nor would I ever make a man who is hostile\\n                            to my country a friend to myself, because I know this, that our country\\n                            is the ship that bears us safe, and that only when we sail her on a straight course can we make\\n                            true friends. Such are the rules by which I strengthen this city. Akin\\n                            to these is the edict which I have now published to the citizenry\\n                            concerning the sons of Oedipus: Eteocles, who fell fighting in behalf of our city and who excelled\\n                            all in battle, they shall entomb and heap up every sacred offering that\\n                            descends to the noblest of the dead below. But as for his brother,\\n                            Polyneices, I mean, who on his return from exile wanted to burn to the\\n                                ground the city of his fathers and his race’s gods, and wanted\\n                            to feed on kindred blood and lead the remnant into slavery—it has been\\n                            proclaimed to the city that no one shall give him funeral honors or\\n                            lamentation, but all must leave him unburied and a sight of shame,\\n                            with his body there for birds and dogs to eat. This is my will, and\\n                            never will I allow the traitor to stand in honor before the just. But\\n                            whoever has good will to he shall\\n                            be honored by me in death as in life. That is your will, Creon, towards this city’s enemy and\\n                            its friend. And the power is yours, I believe, to make use of every law\\n                            whatsoever, both concerning the dead and all us who live. See, then, that you be guardians\\n                            of my commands. Lay the weight of this task on some younger man. That is not what I meant—the guards for the corpse are already in\\n                            place. Then what is this other command that you would give? That you not give way to the breakers of my commands. There is no one so foolish as to\\n                            crave death. I assure you, that is the wage for disobedience. Yet by just the hope of\\n                            it, money has many times corrupted men. My king, I will not say that I arrive breathless because of speed, or\\n                            from the action of a swift foot. For often I brought myself to a stop because of my thoughts, and\\n                            wheeled round in my path to return. My mind was telling me many things: So\\n                            debating, I made my way unhurriedly, slow, and thus a short road was\\n                            made long. At last, however, the view prevailed that I should come\\n                            here—to you. Even if my report brings no good, still will I tell\\n                                you, since I come with a good\\n                            grip on one hope, that I can suffer nothing except what is my fate. And what is it that so disheartens you? I want to tell you first about myself—I did not do the deed, nor did I\\n                            see the doer, so it would be wrong\\n                            that I should come to any harm. Like a bowman you aim well at your target from a distance, and all around\\n                            you hedge yourself off well from the deed. It is clear that you have\\n                            some unheard-of thing to tell. That I do, for terrible news imposes great hesitation. Then tell it, will you, and so unburdened go away? Well, here it is. The corpse—some\\n                            one has just given it burial and disappeared after sprinkling thirsty\\n                            dust on the flesh and performing the other rites that piety demands. What are you saying? What man dared do this? I do not know. For there was no scar of a pickax to be seen\\n                                there, no earth thrown up by a\\n                            mattock. The ground was hard and dry, unbroken, not rolled over by\\n                            wheels. The doer was someone who left no trace. When the first\\n                            day-watchman showed it to us, a discomforting amazement fell on us\\n                                all. The dead man was veiled\\n                            from us—not shut within a tomb, but a light cover of dust was on him, as\\n                            if put there by the hand of one who shunned a curse. And no sign was\\n                            visible that any beast of prey or any dog had approached or torn him.\\n                            Then evil words flew thick and loud among us, guard accusing guard. It would even have come to blows\\n                            in the end, nor was there anyone there to prevent it: every man was the\\n                            culprit, and no one was plainly guilty, while all disclaimed knowledge\\n                            of the act. We were ready to take red-hot iron in our hands, to walk through fire and to swear oaths\\n                            by the gods that we had neither done the deed, nor shared knowledge of\\n                            the planning or the doing. At last, when our investigating got us\\n                            nowhere, someone spoke up and made us all bend our faces in fear towards the earth. For we did\\n                            not know how we could argue with him, nor yet prosper, if we did what he\\n                            said. His argument was that the deed must be reported to you and not\\n                            hidden. This view prevailed, and so it was that the lot doomed miserable me to win this prize. So here\\n                            I stand, as unwelcome to you as I am unwilling, I well know. For no man\\n                            delights in the bearer of bad news. My king, my thoughts have long been deliberating whether this deed is\\n                            somehow the work of gods? Quiet, before your words truly\\n                            fill me with rage, so that you not be found at the same time foolish as\\n                            well as old. You say what is intolerable when you claim that the gods\\n                            have concern for that corpse. Was it in high esteem for his\\n                                benefactions that they sought\\n                            to hide him, when he had come to burn their columned shrines, their\\n                            sacred treasures and their land, and scatter its laws to the winds? Or\\n                            do you see the gods honoring the wicked? It cannot be. No! From the very\\n                                first certain men of the city\\n                            were chafing at this edict and muttering against me, tossing their heads\\n                            in secret, and they did not keep their necks duly under the yoke in\\n                            submission to me. By those men, I am certain, they were led astray and\\n                            bribed to do this deed. Nothing so\\n                            evil as money ever grew to be current among men. This destroys cities,\\n                            this drives men from their homes, this trains and warps honest minds to\\n                            set themselves to works of shame, this teaches people to practise villainies, and to know every act of\\n                            unholiness. But all the men who did this job for hire have made sure\\n                            that, sooner or later, they shall suffer the punishment. Now, as Zeus\\n                            still has my reverence, know this well— I tell you on my oath. If you do not find the very hand\\n                            that made this burial, and reveal him before my eyes, mere death shall\\n                            not suffice for you, not before, hung up alive, you have made this\\n                            outrage plain, so that hereafter\\n                            you may thieve with better knowledge of where your money should be\\n                            received from, and learn that it is best not to be fond of money-making\\n                            from any and every source. For you will find that ill-gotten gains bring\\n                            more men to ruin than to safety. Will you allow me to speak? Or\\n                            shall I just turn and go? Do you not know even now how much your voice sickens me? Is the pain in your ears, or in your soul? And why would you define the seat of my pain? He who did it hurts your heart, but I, your ears. God! How plain it is that you are\\n                            a born babbler. Perhaps, but never the author of this action. Yes, and what is more, you sold your life for silver. Ah! It is truly sad when the judge judges wrong . Expound on show me the perpetrators of these crimes, you\\n                            will avow that money basely earned wreaks sorrows. Well, may the man be found! That would be best. But, whether he be caught\\n                            or not—for fortune must decide that—I assure you that you will not see\\n                            me come here again. Saved just now\\n                            beyond hope and belief, I owe the gods great thanks. Wonders are many, and none is more\\n                            wonderful than man. This power\\n                            spans the sea, even when it surges white before the gales of the\\n                            south-wind, and makes a path under swells that threaten to engulf him.\\n                            Earth, too, the eldest of the gods, the immortal, the\\n                                unwearied, he wears away to\\n                            his own ends, turning the soil with the offspring of horses as the plows\\n                            weave to and fro year after year. The light-hearted tribe of\\n                                birds and the clans of wild\\n                            beasts and the sea-brood of the deep he snares in the meshes of his\\n                            twisted nets, and he leads them captive, very-skilled man. He masters by\\n                            his arts the beast who dwells in\\n                            the wilds and roams the hills. He tames the shaggy-maned horse, putting\\n                            the yoke upon its neck, and tames the tireless mountain bull. Speech and thought fast as\\n                                the wind and the moods that\\n                            give order to a city he has taught himself, and how to flee the arrows\\n                            of the inhospitable frost under clear skies and the arrows of the\\n                            storming rain. He has resource for\\n                            everything. Lacking resource in nothing he strides towards what must\\n                            come. From Death alone he shall procure no escape, but from baffling\\n                            diseases he has devised flights. Possessing resourceful skill, a\\n                            subtlety beyond expectation he moves now to evil, now to good. When he\\n                            honors the laws of the land and the justice of the gods to which he is\\n                            bound by oath, his city prospers.\\n                            But banned from his city is he who, thanks to his rashness, couples with\\n                            disgrace. Never may he share my home, never think my thoughts, who does these things! What marvel sent by the gods is this?—I am\\n                                bewildered! I know her. How can I deny that this girl is Antigone? O\\n                                unhappy child of your unhappy father, of Oedipus! What can this\\n                                mean? What! Surely they are not bringing you captive for disobeying\\n                                the King’s laws and being caught in lunacy? Here is she, the one who did the deed. We caught this one burying him. Where is Creon? There, he is coming from the house again at our need. What is it? What has happened that makes my coming timely? My king, there is nothing that a man can rightly swear he\\n                            will not do. For second thought belies one’s first intent. I could have vowed that I would not ever come here\\n                            again, because of your threats by which I had just been storm-tossed.\\n                            But since this joy that exceeds and oversteps my hopes can be compared\\n                            in fulness to no other pleasure, I am back—though it is contrary to my\\n                            sworn oath— bringing this girl who\\n                            was caught giving burial honors to the dead. This time there was no\\n                            casting of lots. No, this piece of luck has fallen to me, and me alone.\\n                            And now, my king, as it pleases you, take her yourself, question her and\\n                            convict her. But justice would see me released free and clear from this trouble. Your prisoner here—how and where did you take her? She was burying the man. You know all there is to tell. Are you clear and sure about what you are saying? I am. I saw her burying the corpse that you had forbidden to bury. Is that plain and\\n                            sufficient? And how was she observed? How taken in the act? It happened like this. When we had come to the place with those fierce\\n                            threats of yours still in our ears, we swept away all the dust that\\n                                covered the corpse and bared\\n                            the damp body well. We then sat down on the brow of the hill to\\n                            windward, fleeing the smell from him, lest it strike us. Each man was\\n                            wide awake and kept his neighbor alert with torrents of threats, if any\\n                            one should be careless of this task. So time passed, until the disk of the sun stood bright\\n                            in mid-sky and the heat began to burn. And then suddenly a whirlwind\\n                            lifted from the earth a storm of dust, a trouble in the sky, and it\\n                            filled the plain, marring all the foliage of its woods. Soon the wide air was choked with it. We closed\\n                            our eyes, and endured the plague from the gods. When, after a long\\n                            while, this storm had passed, the girl was seen, and she wailed aloud\\n                            with the sharp cry of a grieving bird, as when inside her\\n                                empty nest she sees the bed\\n                            stripped of its nestlings. So she, too, when she saw the corpse bare,\\n                            broke into a cry of lamentation and cursed with harsh curses those who\\n                            had done it. Immediately she took thirsty dust in her hands, and from a pitcher of beaten bronze held\\n                            high she crowned the dead with thrice-poured libations. We rushed\\n                            forward when we saw it, and at once closed upon our quarry, who was not\\n                            at all dismayed. We then charged her with her past and present\\n                                doings, but she made no denial of anything—at once to my joy and\\n                            to my pain. For to have escaped from trouble one’s self gives the\\n                            greatest joy, but it stings to lead friends to evil. Naturally, though,\\n                            all such things are of less account to me than my own safety. You, you with your face bent to the ground, do you admit, or deny that\\n                            you did this? I declare it and make no denial. You can take yourself wherever you please, free and clear of a heavy charge. I knew it. How could I not? It was public. And even so you dared overstep that law? Yes, since it was not Zeus that\\n                            published me that edict, and since not of that kind are the laws which\\n                            Justice who dwells with the gods below established among men. Nor did I\\n                            think that your decrees were of such force, that a mortal could override\\n                            the unwritten and unfailing statutes given us by the gods. For their\\n                            life is not of today or yesterday, but for all time, and no man knows\\n                            when they were first put forth. Not for fear of any man’s pride was I\\n                            about to owe a penalty to the gods for breaking these. Die I\\n                            must, that I knew well (how could I not?). That is true even without\\n                            your edicts. But if I am to die before my time, I count that a gain.\\n                            When anyone lives as I do, surrounded by evils, how can he not carry off\\n                            gain by dying? So for me to meet this doom is a grief of no account.\\n                            But if I had endured that my mother’s son should in death lie an\\n                            unburied corpse, that would have grieved me. Yet for this, I am not\\n                            grieved. And if my present actions are foolish in your sight, it may\\n                            be that it is a fool who accuses me of folly. She shows herself the wild offspring of a wild father, and does not know\\n                            how to bend before troubles. Yet remember that over-hard spirits most often collapse. It is the\\n                            stiffest iron, baked to utter hardness in the fire, that you most often see\\n                            snapped and shivered. And I have witnessed horses with great spirit\\n                            disciplined by a small bit. For there is no place for pride, when one is\\n                            his neighbors’ slave. This girl was already\\n                            practiced in outrage when she overstepped the published laws. And, that\\n                            done, this now is a second outrage, that she glories in it and exults in\\n                            her deed. In truth, then, I am no man, but she is, if this victory rests with her and brings no penalty.\\n                            No! Whether she is my sister’s child, or nearer to me in blood than any\\n                            of my kin that worship Zeus at the altar of our house, she and her\\n                            sister will not escape a doom most harsh. For in truth I charge that other with an equal share\\n                            in the plotting of this burial. Call her out! I saw her inside just now,\\n                            raving, and not in control of her wits. Before the deed, the mind\\n                            frequently is convicted of stealthy crimes when conspirators are\\n                            plotting depravity in the dark. But, truly, I detest it, too, when one who has been caught in\\n                            treachery then seeks to make the crime a glory. What more do you want than to capture and kill me? I want nothing else. Having that, I have everything. Why then do you wait? In none of your maxims is there anything that pleases me—and may there never\\n                            be! Similarly to you as well my views must be displeasing. And yet, how\\n                            could I have won a nobler glory than by giving burial to my own brother?\\n                            All here would admit that they approve, if fear did not grip their tongues. But tyranny, blest\\n                            with so much else, has the power to do and say whatever it pleases. You alone out of all these Thebans see it that way. They do, too, but for you they hold their tongues. Are you not ashamed that your\\n                            beliefs differ from theirs? No, there is nothing shameful in respecting your own flesh and blood. Was not he your brother too, who died in the opposite cause? A brother by the same mother and the same father. Why, then, do you pay a service that is disrespectful to him? The dead man will not support you\\n                            in that. Yes, he will, if you honor him equally with the wicked one. It was his brother, not his slave, who died. But he died ravaging this land, while he fell in its defense. Hades craves these rites, nevertheless. But the good man craves a portion not equal to the\\n                            evil’s. Who knows but that these actions are pure to those below? You do not love someone you have hated, not even after death. It is not my nature to join in hate, but in love. Then, go down to hell and love them if you must. While I live, no woman will rule me. Look, here comes Ismene from the palace, shedding the tears of a loving\\n                            sister. A cloud over her eyes mars her red-flushed face, and it breaks into rain on her comely\\n                            cheek. You who were lurking like a viper in my own house and\\n                                secretly gulping up my life’s blood, while I was oblivious that I\\n                                was nurturing two plagues, two revolutions against my throne—tell me\\n                                now, will you also affirm your share in this\\n                            burial, or will you forswear all knowledge of it? I performed the deed—as long as she concurs—and I share and carry the\\n                            burden of guilt. No, justice will not permit you to do this, since you were not willing to\\n                            help with the deed, nor did I give you a part in it. But now with this sea of troubles\\n                            around you, I am not ashamed to sail in a sea of suffering at your\\n                            side. As to whose deed it is, Hades and the dead are witnesses. A friend in\\n                            words is not the type of friend I love. No, sister, do not strip me of death’s honor, but let me die with you and make due consecration to\\n                            the dead. Do not share my death. Do not claim deeds to which you did not put your\\n                            hand. My death will suffice. And how can I cherish life, once I am deprived of you? Ask Creon. Your concern is for him. Why do you torture me like this,\\n                            when it does not help you? No, if I mock you, it is to my own pain that I do so. Tell me, how can I help you, even now? Save yourself. I do not grudge your escape. Ah, misery! Will I fall short of sharing your fate? Your choice was to live, it was\\n                            mine to die. At least your choice was not made without my protests. One world approved your wisdom, another approved mine. Nevertheless, the offense is identical for both of us. Take heart! You live. But my life has long been in Death’s hands so that I might serve the dead. One of these maidens, I declare, has just revealed her foolishness; the\\n                            other has displayed it from the moment of her birth. Yes, Creon. Whatever amount of reason nature may have given them does not\\n                            remain with those in dire straits, but goes astray. Yours did, I know, when you chose\\n                            dire actions with dire allies. What life would there be for me alone, without her presence? Do not speak of her What? You will kill your own son’s bride? Why not? There are other fields for him to plough. But not fitted to him as she\\n                            was. I abhor an evil wife for my son. Haemon, dearest! How your father wrongs you! Enough! Enough of you and of your marriage! Will you really cheat your son of this girl? Death it is who will end these\\n                            bridals for me. Then it seems that it is resolved that she will die. Resolved, yes, for you and by me. For it is\\n                            known that even the brave seek to flee, when they see Death now closing\\n                            on their life. Blest are those whose days have\\n                            not tasted of evil. For when a house has once been shaken by the\\n                                gods, no form of ruin is\\n                            lacking, but it spreads over the bulk of the race, just as, when the\\n                            surge is driven over the darkness of the deep by the fierce breath of\\n                            Thracian sea-winds, it rolls up\\n                            the black sand from the depths, and the wind-beaten headlands that front\\n                            the blows of the storm give out a mournful roar. I see that the ancient sorrows of\\n                            the house of the Labdacids are\\n                            heaped upon the sorrows of the dead. Each generation does not set its\\n                            race free, but some god hurls it down and the race has no release. For\\n                            now that dazzling ray of hope that had been spread over the last roots in the house of\\n                            Oedipus—that hope, in its turn, the blood-stained dust of the gods\\n                            infernal and mindlessness in speech and frenzy at the mind cuts\\n                            down. Your power, great Zeus—what human\\n                            overstepping can check it? Yours is power that neither Sleep, the\\n                            all-ensnaring, nor the untiring months of the gods can defeat. Unaged\\n                            through time, you rule by your\\n                            power and dwell thereby in the brilliant splendor of See how that hope whose wanderings\\n                            are so wide truly is a benefit to many men, but to an equal number it is\\n                            a false lure of light-headed desires. The deception comes to one who is\\n                            wholly unawares until he burns his foot on a hot fire. For with wisdom did someone once reveal the\\n                            maxim, now famous, that evil at one time or another seems good, to him\\n                            whose mind a god leads to ruin. But for the briefest moment such a man fares free of destruction. But here is Haemon, the last of\\n                            your offspring. Does he come grieving for the doom of Antigone, his\\n                            promised bride, and bitter for the\\n                            deceived hope of their marriage? We will soon know better than seers could tell us.—My son, can it be that\\n                            after hearing the final judgment concerning your betrothed, you have\\n                            come in rage against your father? Or do I have your loyalty, act how I\\n                            may? Father, I am yours, and you keep\\n                            me upright with precepts good for me—precepts I shall follow. No\\n                            marriage will be deemed by me more important than your good\\n                            guidance. Yes, my son, this is the spirit you should maintain in\\n                            your heart—to stand behind your father’s will in all things. It is for\\n                            this that men pray: to sire and raise in their homes children who are\\n                            obedient, that they may requite their father’s enemy with evil and honor\\n                            his friend, just as their father does. But the man who begets\\n                            unhelpful children—what would you say that he has sown except miseries\\n                            for himself and abundant exultation for his enemies? Never, then, my\\n                            son, banish your reason for pleasure on account of a woman, knowing that this embrace soon becomes\\n                            cold and brittle—an evil woman to share your bed and home. For what\\n                            wound could strike deeper than a false friend? No, spit her out as if\\n                            she were an enemy, let her go find a husband in Hades. For since I caught her alone of all the city in\\n                            open defiance, I will not make myself a liar to my city. I will kill\\n                            her. So let her call on Zeus who protects kindred blood. If I am to\\n                            foster my own kin to spurn order, surely I will do the same for outsiders. For whoever shows his\\n                            excellence in the case of his own household will be found righteous in\\n                            his city as well. But if anyone oversteps and does violence to the laws,\\n                            or thinks to dictate to those in power, such a one will never win praise from me. No, whomever\\n                            the city may appoint, that man must be obeyed in matters small and great\\n                            and in matters just and unjust. And I would feel confident that such a\\n                            man would be a fine ruler no less than a good and willing\\n                                subject, and that beneath a\\n                            hail of spears he would stand his ground where posted, a loyal and brave\\n                            comrade in the battle line. But there is no evil worse than\\n                            disobedience. This destroys cities; this overturns homes; this\\n                                breaks the ranks of allied spears into headlong rout. But the\\n                            lives of men who prosper upright, of these obedience has saved the\\n                            greatest part. Therefore we must defend those who respect order, and in\\n                            no way can we let a woman defeat us. It is better to fall from power, if\\n                            it is fated, by a man’s hand, than that we be called weaker than\\n                            women. To us, unless our years have stolen our wit, you seem to say what you say\\n                            wisely. Father, the gods implant reason in men, the highest of all things that we\\n                            call our own. For my part, to\\n                            state how you are wrong to say those things is beyond my power and my\\n                            desire, although another man, too, might have a useful thought. In any\\n                            case, it is my natural duty to watch on your behalf all that men say, or\\n                            do, or find to blame. For dread of\\n                            your glance forbids the ordinary citizen to speak such words as would\\n                            offend your ear. But I can hear these murmurs in the dark, how the city\\n                            moans for this girl, saying: Such is the rumor\\n                            shrouded in darkness that silently spreads. For me, father, no treasure\\n                            is more precious than your prosperity. What, indeed, is a nobler\\n                            ornament for children than the fair fame of a thriving father, or for a\\n                            father than that of his children? Do not, then, bear one mood only in yourself: do not think that your\\n                            word and no other, must be right. For if any man thinks that he alone is\\n                            wise—that in speech or in mind he has no peer—such a soul, when laid\\n                            open, is always found empty. No,\\n                            even when a man is wise, it brings him no shame to learn many things,\\n                            and not to be too rigid. You see how the trees that stand beside the\\n                            torrential streams created by a winter storm yield to it and save their\\n                            branches, while the stiff and rigid perish root and all? And in the same way the pilot who keeps\\n                            the sheet of his sail taut and never slackens it, upsets his boat, and\\n                            voyages thereafter with his decking underwater. Father, give way and\\n                            allow a change from your rage. For if even from me, a younger man, a\\n                            worthy thought may be supplied, by\\n                            far the best thing, I believe, would be for men to be all-wise by\\n                            nature. Otherwise—since most often it does not turn out that way—it is\\n                            good to learn in addition from those who advise you well. My king, it is right, if he speaks something appropriate, that you should\\n                            learn from him and that you, in\\n                            turn, Haemon, should learn from your father. On both sides there have\\n                            been wise words. Men of my age—are we, then, to be schooled in wisdom by men of his? Not in anything that is not right. But if I am young, you should look to\\n                            my conduct, not to my years. Is it worthy conduct to honor\\n                            disrupters? I could not urge anyone to show respect for the wicked. And is she not in the grasp of that disease? All the people of this city of Shall See, there, how you have spoken so\\n                            much like a child. Am I to rule this land by the will of another than myself? That is no city, which belongs to one man. Does not the city by tradition belong to the man in power? You would make a fine monarch in a desert. This boy seems to be fighting on\\n                            the side of the woman. If you are a woman, for, to be sure, my concern is for you. You traitor, attacking your father, accusing him! Because I see you making a mistake and committing injustice. Am I making a mistake when I respect my own prerogatives? Yes. You do not respect them, when you trample on the\\n                            gods’ honors. Polluted creature, submitting to a woman! You will never catch me submitting to shamelessness. You do. Your every word, after all, pleads her case. And yours, and mine, and that of gods below. You can never marry her, not while\\n                            she is still alive. Then she will die, and in death destroy another. What! Does your audacity run to open threats? How is it a threat to speak against empty plans? You will regret your unwise instructions in wisdom. If you were not my father, I would\\n                            have called you insane. You woman’s slave, do not try to cajole me. Do you want to have your say and then have done without a reply? Is that so? By Olympus above—know this well—you will have no joy for\\n                            taunting me over and above your censures. Bring out that hated thing, so that with him looking on\\n                            she may die right now in her bridegroom’s presence and at his side! No, not at my side will she die—do not ever imagine it. Nor shall you\\n                            ever look at me and set eyes on my face again. Indulge in your madness now with whomever of your\\n                            friends can endure it. The man is gone, King Creon, in anger and haste. A young mind is fierce\\n                            when stung. Let him do—no!—let him plan something more immense than befits a man.\\n                            Farewell to him! Still he will not save these two girls from death. Then the pair of them, you really\\n                            intend to kill them both? Not the one who did not put her hands to the burial. You are right. And by what mode of death do you mean to kill the other? I will take her where the path is deserted, unvisited by men, and entomb\\n                            her alive in a rocky vault, setting out a ration of food, but only as much as piety requires so\\n                            that all the city may escape defilement. And praying there to Hades, the\\n                            only god she worships, perhaps she will obtain immunity from death, or\\n                            else will learn, at last, even this late, that it is fruitless labor to revere the\\n                                dead. Love, the unconquered in battle, Love, you who descend\\n                                upon riches, and watch the night through on a girl’s soft cheek, you roam over\\n                            the sea and among the homes of men in the wilds. Neither can any\\n                            immortal escape you, nor any man\\n                            whose life lasts for a day. He who has known you is driven to\\n                            madness. You seize the minds of just men\\n                            and drag them to injustice, to their ruin. You it is who have incited\\n                            this conflict of men whose flesh and blood are one. But victory belongs to radiant Desire swelling\\n                            from the eyes of the sweet-bedded bride. Desire sits enthroned in power\\n                            beside the mighty laws. For in all\\n                            this divine Aphrodite plays her irresistible game. But now, witnessing this, I too am\\n                            carried beyond the bounds of loyalty. The power fails me to keep back my\\n                            streaming tears any longer, when I see Antigone making her way to the\\n                            chamber where all are laid to rest, now her bridal chamber. Citizens of my fatherland, see me\\n                            setting out on my last journey, looking at my last sunlight, and never again. No, Hades who lays all to rest leads me\\n                                living to for the crowning of marriage. Instead\\n                            the lord of Then in glory and with praise you\\n                            depart to that deep place of the dead, neither struck by wasting\\n                                sickness, nor having won the\\n                            wages of the sword. No, guided by your own laws and still alive, unlike\\n                            any mortal before, you will descend to Hades. I have heard with my own ears how\\n                            our Phrygian guest, the daughter of Tantalus, perished in so much suffering on steep Sipylus—how, like\\n                            clinging ivy, the sprouting stone subdued her. And the rains, as men\\n                            tell, do not leave her melting form, nor does the snow, but beneath her weeping lids she dampens her\\n                            collar. Most like hers is the god-sent fate that leads me to my\\n                            rest. Yet she was a goddess, as you\\n                            know, and the offspring of gods, while we are mortals and mortal-born. Still it is a great thing for a\\n                            woman who has died to have it said of her that she shared the lot of the\\n                            godlike in her life, and afterwards, in death. Ah, you mock me! In the name of our fathers’ gods, why do you not\\n                            wait to abuse me until after I have gone, and not to my face, O my city,\\n                            and you, her wealthy citizens? Ah, spring of Dirce, and you holy ground\\n                            of you, at least, will bear\\n                            me witness how unwept by loved ones, and by what laws I go to the\\n                            rock-closed prison of my unheard-of tomb! Ah, misery! I have no home among men or with the shades, no\\n                            home with the living or with the dead. You have rushed headlong to the\\n                            far limits of daring, and against the high throne of Justice you have fallen, my daughter, fallen\\n                            heavily. But in this ordeal you are paying for some paternal crime. You have touched on my most bitter\\n                                thought and moved my ever-renewed pity for my father and for the\\n                                entire doom ordained for us, the famed house of Labdacus. Oh, the\\n                                horrors of our mother’s bed! Oh, the slumbers of the wretched mother\\n                                at the side of her own son, my own father! What manner of parents\\n                            gave me my miserable being! It is to them that I go like this, accursed\\n                            and unwed, to share their home. Ah, my brother, the marriage you made was doomed, and by dying you\\n                            killed me still alive! Your pious action shows a certain\\n                            reverence, but an offence against power can no way be tolerated by him\\n                            who has power in his keeping. Your\\n                            self-willed disposition is what has destroyed you. Unwept, unfriended, without\\n                            marriage-song, I am led in misery on this journey that cannot be put\\n                            off. No longer is it permitted me, unhappy girl, to look up at this sacred eye of the burning\\n                            sun. But for my fate no tear is shed, no friend moans in sorrow. Do you not know that dirges and\\n                            wailing before death would never be given up, if it were allowed to make\\n                            them freely? Take her away—now!\\n                            And when you have enshrouded her, as I proclaimed, in her covered tomb,\\n                            leave her alone, deserted—let her decide whether she wishes to die or to\\n                            live entombed in such a home. It makes no difference, since our hands\\n                            are clean so far as regards this girl. But no matter what, she will be stripped of her home\\n                            here above. Tomb, bridal-chamber, deep-dug eternal prison where I go to find my own,\\n                            whom in the greatest numbers destruction has seized and Persephone has\\n                            welcomed among the dead! Last of\\n                            them all and in by far the most shameful circumstances, I will descend,\\n                            even before the fated term of my life is spent. But I cherish strong\\n                            hopes that I will arrive welcome to my father, and pleasant to you,\\n                            Mother, and welcome, dear brother, to you. For, when each of you died, with my own hands I washed\\n                            and dressed you and poured drink-offerings at your graves. But now,\\n                            Polyneices, it is for tending your corpse that I win such reward as\\n                            this. Well, then, if these events please the gods, once I have suffered my\\n                            doom I will come to know my guilt. But if the guilt lies with my judges,\\n                            I could wish for them no greater evils than they inflict unjustly on\\n                            me. Still the same tempest of the soul grips this girl with the same fierce gusts. Then because of this her guards will have reason to lament their\\n                            slowness. Ah, no! That command verges close on death. I cannot console you with any hope\\n                            that your doom is not to be fulfilled in that way. O city of my fathers, land of Look at me, you who are So too endured Danae in her beauty\\n                            to change the light of the sky for\\n                            brass-bound walls, and in that chamber, both burial and bridal, she was\\n                            held in strict confinement. And yet was she of esteemed lineage, my\\n                                daughter, and guarded a\\n                            deposit of the seed of Zeus that had fallen in a golden rain. But\\n                            dreadful is the mysterious power of fate—there is no deliverance from it\\n                            by wealth or by war, by towered city, or dark, sea-beaten ships. And Dryas’s son, the Edonian king swift to rage, was\\n                                tamed in recompense for his frenzied insults, when, by the will of\\n                                Dionysus, he was shut in a rocky prison. There the fierce and\\n                                swelling force of his madness trickled away. That man came to know the god whom in his\\n                            frenzy he had provoked with mockeries. For he had sought to quell the\\n                            god-inspired women and the Bacchanalian fire, and he angered the Muses who love the flute. And by the waters of the Dark\\n                            Rocks, the waters of the twofold sea, are the shores of where Ares,\\n                            neighbor of that city, saw the accursed, blinding wound inflicted on the\\n                            two sons of Phineus by his savage wife. It was a wound that brought\\n                            darkness to the hollows, making them crave vengeance for the eyes she crushed with her bloody hands\\n                            and with her shuttle for a dagger. Wasting away in their misery, they\\n                            bewailed their miserable suffering and their birth from their mother stripped of her\\n                                marriage. But she traced her descent from the ancient line of the\\n                                Erechtheids, and in far-distant caves she was raised amidst her\\n                                father’s gusts. She was the child of Boreas, running swift as\\n                            horses over the steep hills, a daughter of gods. Yet she, too, was\\n                            assailed by the long-lived Fates, my child. Princes of For this is the method of travel for the blind, using a\\n                            guide. What is it, old Teiresias? What is your news? I will tell you. You, obey the seer. It was not my habit before, at any rate, to stand apart\\n                            from your will. Therefore you captained this city on an upright course. I have felt and can attest your benefits. Realize that once more now you are poised on fortune’s\\n                            razor-edge. What do you mean? I shudder to hear you! You will understand, when you hear the signs revealed by my\\n                            art. As I took my place on my old seat of augury where all birds regularly gather for me, I heard an\\n                            unintelligible voice among them: they were screaming in dire frenzy that\\n                            made their language foreign to me. I realized that they were ripping\\n                            each other with their talons, murderously—the rush of their wings did\\n                            not lack meaning. Quickly, in fear, I tried burnt-sacrifice on a\\n                            duly-kindled altar, but from my offerings Hephaestus did not blaze.\\n                            Instead juice that had sweated from the thigh-flesh trickled out onto\\n                            the embers and smoked and sputtered; the gall was scattered high up in the air; and the\\n                            streaming thighs lay bared of the fat that had been wrapped around them.\\n                            Such was the failure of the rites that yielded no sign, as I learned\\n                            from this boy. For he is my guide, as I am guide to others. And it is your will that is the source of the sickness\\n                            now afflicting the city. For the altars of our city and our hearths have\\n                            one and all been tainted by the birds and dogs with the carrion taken\\n                            from the sadly fallen son of Oedipus. And so the gods no more accept\\n                            prayer and sacrifice at our hands, or the burning of thigh-meat, nor does any bird sound\\n                            out clear signs in its shrill cries, for they have tasted the fatness of\\n                            a slain man’s blood. Think, therefore, on these things, my son. All men\\n                            are liable to err. But when an error is made, that man is no longer unwise\\n                            or unblessed who heals the evil into which he has fallen and does not\\n                            remain stubborn. Self-will, we know, invites the charge of foolishness.\\n                            Concede the claim of the dead. Do not kick at the fallen. What prowess is it to kill the dead all over again? I\\n                            have considered for your good, and what I advise is good. The sweetest\\n                            thing is to learn from a good advisor when his advice is to your\\n                            profit. Old man, you all shoot your arrows at me, like archers at\\n                            their mark, and I am not safe even from the plottings of the seer’s divine art, but\\n                            by their tribe I have long been bought and sold and made their\\n                            merchandise. Turn your profits, make your deals for the white gold of not even if the eagles of Zeus wish to snatch and carry\\n                            him to be devoured at the god’s throne. No, not even then, for fear of\\n                            that defilement will I permit his burial, since I know with certainty\\n                            that no mortal has the power to defile the gods. But even the exceedingly clever, old Teiresias, falls\\n                            with a shameful fall, when they couch shameful thoughts in fine phrasing\\n                            for profit’s sake. Alas! Does any man know, does any consider— What is this? What universal truth are you announcing? —by how much the most precious of our possessions is\\n                            the power to reason wisely? By as much, I think, as senselessness is the greatest\\n                            affliction. Yet you came into being full of that disease. I have no desire to trade insults with the seer. Yet that is what you do in saying that I prophesy\\n                            falsely. Yes, for the prophet-clan was ever fond of money. And the race sprung from tyrants loves shameful gain. Do you know that you ramble so about your king? I am aware, since through me you have saved this city. You are a wise seer, but fond of doing injustice. You will stir me to utter the dire secret in my\\n                            soul. Out with it! But only if it is not for gain that you speak\\n                            it. Indeed, I think I speak without mention of gain—where you\\n                            are concerned. Be certain that you will not trade in my will. Then know, yes, know it well! You will not live through\\n                            many more courses of the sun’s swift chariot, before you will\\n                            give in return one sprung from your own loins, a corpse in requital for\\n                            corpses. For you have thrust below one of those of the upper air and\\n                            irreverently lodged a living soul in the grave, while you detain in this world that which belongs to\\n                            the infernal gods, a corpse unburied, unmourned, unholy. In the dead you\\n                            have no part, nor do the gods above, but in this you do them violence.\\n                            For these crimes the avenging destroyers, the Furies of Hades and of the gods, lie in ambush for\\n                            you, waiting to seize you in these same sufferings. And look closely if\\n                            I tell you this with a silvered palm. A time not long to be delayed will\\n                            reveal in your house wailing over men and over women. All the cities are stirred up in hostility, whose\\n                            mangled corpses the dogs, or the wild beasts or some winged bird buried,\\n                            carrying an unholy stench to the city that held each man’s hearth.\\n                            There, now, are arrows for your heart, since you provoke me, launched at you, archer-like, in my anger. They fly\\n                            true—you cannot run from their burning sting. Boy, lead me home, so that\\n                            he may launch his rage against younger men, and learn to keep a quieter\\n                            tongue and a better mind within his breast than he now\\n                                bears. The man is gone, my king, leaving dire prophecies behind.\\n                            And for all the time that I have had this hair on my head, now white,\\n                            once dark, I know that he has never been a false prophet to our\\n                            city. I, too, know it well, and my mind is troubled. To yield\\n                            is terrible, but, to resist, to strike my pride with ruin—this, too,\\n                            inspires terror. The moment, Creon, requires that you reason wisely. What should I do, then? Speak, and I will obey. Go and free the girl from her hollowed chamber. Then\\n                            raise a tomb for the unburied dead. And you recommend this? You think that I should yield? Yes, my king, and with all possible speed. For harms sent\\n                            from the gods swiftly cut short the follies of men. Ah, it is a struggle, but I depart from my heart’s\\n                            resolve and obey. We must not wage vain wars with necessity. Go, do these things and do not leave their performance to\\n                            others. Right away I will go. Go, go, my servants, each and all of\\n                            you! Take axes in your hands, and hurry to that place there in view! But since my\\n                            judgment has taken this turn, I will be there to set her free, as I\\n                            myself confined her. I am held by the fear that it is best to keep the\\n                            established laws to life’s very end. God of many names, glory of the\\n                            Cadmeian bride and offspring of loud-thundering Zeus, you who watch over\\n                            far-famed in the valleys of\\n                            Eleusinian Deo where all find welcome! O Bacchus, denizen of of the sowing of the savage dragon’s teeth! The smoky glare of torches sees\\n                            you above the cliffs of the twin peaks, where the Corycian nymphs move\\n                            inspired by your godhead, and Castalia’s stream sees you, too. The ivy-mantled\\n                                slopes of you visit the\\n                            avenues of And now when the whole city is held subject to a\\n                            violent plague, come, we ask, with purifying feet over steep or over the groaning straits! O Leader of the chorus of the\\n                            stars whose breath is fire, overseer of the chants in the night, son\\n                            begotten of Zeus, appear, my\\n                            king, with your attendant Thyiads, who in night-long frenzy dance and\\n                            sing you as Iacchus the Giver! Neighbors of the house of Cadmus and of Amphion, there\\n                            is no station of human life that I would ever praise or blame as being\\n                            settled. Fortune sets upright and Fortune sinks the lucky and unlucky\\n                            from day to day, and no one can prophesy to men concerning the order\\n                            that has just been established. For Creon, as I saw it, was once blest:\\n                            he had saved this land of Cadmus from its enemies; and having won sole\\n                            and total dominion in the land, he guided it on a straight course and\\n                            flourished in his noble crop of children. And now all this has been lost. When a man has\\n                            forfeited his pleasures, I do not reckon his existence as life, but\\n                            consider him just a breathing corpse. Heap up riches in your house, if\\n                            you wish! Live with a tyrant’s pomp! But if there is no joy along with all of that, I would not pay even the shadow\\n                            of smoke for all the rest, compared with joy. What is this new grief for our princes that you have come\\n                            to report? They are dead, and the living are guilty of the deaths. Who is the murderer? Who the murdered? Tell us. Haemon is dead—his blood was shed by no strange\\n                            hand. Was it his father’s, or his own ? He did it by his own, enraged with his father for the\\n                            murder. Ah, prophet, how true, then, you have proved your word! Knowing that these things are so, you must consider the\\n                            rest. Wait, I see the unhappy Eurydice, Creon’s wife, nearby.\\n                            She comes from the house either knowing of her son, or merely by\\n                            chance. People of At one and the same time I was loosening the bolts of\\n                            the gate to open it, and the sound of a blow to our house struck my ear.\\n                            In terror I sank back into the arms of my handmaids, and my senses fled. But repeat what your news was, for I shall hear it with\\n                            ears that are no strangers to sorrow. Dear mistress, I will tell what I witnessed and leave no\\n                            word of the truth unspoken. For what good would it do that should I\\n                            soothe you with words in which I must later be found false? The truth is always best. I attended your husband as\\n                            his guide to the furthest part of the plain, where unpitied the body of\\n                            Polyneices, torn by dogs, still lay. After we had prayed to the goddess\\n                            of the roads and to Pluto to restrain their anger in mercy, we\\n                            washed him with pure washing, and with freshly-plucked boughs we burned\\n                            what remains there were. Lastly we heaped a high-mounded tomb of his\\n                            native earth. Afterwards we turned away to enter the maiden’s\\n                            stoney-bedded bridal chamber, the caverned mansion of Hades’ bride.\\n                            From a distance, one of us servants heard a voice of loud wailing near\\n                            that bride’s unwept bed and came to tell our master Creon. And as the\\n                            King moved closer and closer, obscure signs rising from a bitter cry\\n                            surrounded him— he groaned and said in bitter lament, What would you infer from this? The lady has turned back and gone without a word, either for\\n                            good or for evil. I, too, am startled. Still I am nourished by the hope that\\n                            at the grave news of her son she thinks it unworthy to make her laments\\n                            before the city, but in the shelter of her home will set her handmaids\\n                            to mourn the house’s grief. For she is not unhabituated to discretion, that she\\n                            should err. I do not know. But to me, in any case, a silence too strict\\n                            seems to promise trouble just as much as a fruitless abundance of\\n                            weeping. I will find out whether she is not, in fact, hiding some\\n                            repressed plan in the darkness of her passionate heart. I will go in, since you are right—in an excess of\\n                            silence, too, there may be trouble. Look, here is the King himself approaching, his hands\\n                                grasping a monument plainly signing that his—if we may say it—and no\\n                                one else’s, was the madness of this error. Ah, the blunders of an unthinking\\n                            mind, blunders of rigidity, yielding death! Oh, you witnesses of the\\n                            killers and the killed, both of one family! What misery arises from my reasonings! Haemon, you have\\n                            died after a young life, youngest and last of my sons! O God! You have\\n                            departed not by your foolishness, but by my own! Ah, how late you seem to see the\\n                            right! God, I have mastered the bitter lesson! But then, then, I think, some god\\n                            struck me on my head with a crushing weight, and drove me into savage\\n                                paths, —ah!—and overthrew my\\n                            joy to be trampled on! Ah, the labors men must toil through! My master, you have come, I\\n                            think, like one whose hands are not empty, but who has a ready store:\\n                            first, you carry that burden visible in your arms; second, you will soon look upon further\\n                            sufferings inside your house. What worse suffering is still to follow upon these sufferings? Your wife is dead, true mother of that corpse, poor lady, by wounds newly\\n                            cut. O harbor of Hades, hard to\\n                                purify! Why, why do you ruin\\n                            me? Herald of evil, of grief, what word do you say? Ah, you have done in\\n                            a dead man anew! What are you saying, boy? What is this you report to\\n                                me God no!—what new slaughter, my wife’s doom, is heaped\\n                                upon this ruin? The sight is at hand. It is no longer hidden inside. Ah, misery! There I see a new, a\\n                            second evil! What destiny, ah, what, can still await me? I have just now\\n                            taken my son in my arms, and now I see another corpse before\\n                                me! Oh, tormented mother! Oh,\\n                            my son! By the altar, with a\\n                            sharp-whetted sword, she struck until her eyes went slack and dark.\\n                            Before that she bewailed the noble fate of Megareus who died earlier,\\n                            and then the fate of this boy, and also, with her last breath, she called down evil fortune upon you,\\n                            the slayer of her sons. Ah, no! I tremble with fear. Why\\n                            does no one strike me full on my chest with a two-edged sword? I am miserable—ah—and bathed in\\n                            miserable anguish! Yes, because you were accused of responsibility for both\\n                                this son’s death, and the other’s, by her whose corpse you see. What was the manner of the violent deed by which she departed? Her own hand struck her to the heart upon learning her\\n                                son’s sharply-lamented fate. Ah this guilt can never be\\n                            fastened onto any other mortal so as to remove my own! It was I, yes, I,\\n                            who killed you, I the wretch. I\\n                            admit the truth. Lead me away, my servants, lead me from here with all\\n                            haste, who am no more than a dead man! The course you recommend is to\\n                            your gain, if there can be gain amidst evil. What is briefest is best,\\n                            when trouble lies at your feet. Let it come, let it appear, that\\n                            fairest of fates for me, that brings my final day, the fate supreme! Oh, let it come, so that I may never\\n                                see tomorrow’s light! These things are in the future.\\n                            We must see to present affairs. Fulfillment of these things rests in the hands where it should\\n                            rest. All that I crave was summed in that prayer. Then pray no more; for mortals have no release from destined\\n                            misfortune. Lead me away, I beg you, a rash,\\n                            useless man. I have murdered you,\\n                            son, unwittingly, and you, too, my wife—the misery! I do not know which\\n                            way I should look, or where I should seek support. All is amiss that is in my hands, and, again,\\n                            a crushing fate has leapt upon my head. Wisdom is provided as the chief\\n                            part of happiness, and our dealings with the gods must be in no way\\n                            unholy. The great words of arrogant men have to make repayment with\\n                            great blows, and in old age teach wisdom.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I, the son of Zeus, have come to this land of the Thebans—Dionysus, whom once Semele, Kadmos’ daughter, bore, delivered by a lightning-bearing flame. And having taken a mortal form instead of a god’s, I am here at the fountains of Dirke and the water of Ismenus. And I see the tomb of my thunder-stricken mother here near the palace, and the remnants of her house, smouldering with the still living flame of Zeus’ fire, the everlasting insult of Hera against my mother. I praise Kadmos, who has made this place hallowed, the shrine of his daughter; and I have covered it all around with the cluster-bearing leaf of the vine.\\nI have left the wealthy lands of the Lydians and Phrygians, the sun-parched plains of the Persians, and the Bactrian walls, and have passed over the wintry land of the Medes, and blessed and I have come to this Hellene city first, having already set those other lands to dance and established my mysteries there, so that I might be a deity manifest among men. In this land of taking a thyrsos in my hand, a weapon of ivy. For my mother’s sisters, the ones who least should, claimed that I, Dionysus, was not the child of Zeus, but that Semele had conceived a child from a mortal father and then ascribed the sin of her bed to Zeus, a trick of Kadmos’, for which they boasted that Zeus killed her, because she had told a false tale about her marriage. Therefore I have goaded them from the house in frenzy, and they dwell in the mountains, out of their wits; and I have compelled them to wear the outfit of my mysteries. And all the female offspring of that it is not initiated into my Bacchic rites, and that I plead the case of my mother, Semele, in appearing manifest to mortals as a divinity whom she bore to Zeus. who fights against the gods as far as I am concerned and drives me away from sacrifices, and in his prayers makes no mention of me, for which I will show him and all the Thebans that I was born a god. And when I have set matters here right, I will move on to another land, revealing myself. But if ever the city of But, you women who have left Tmolus, the bulwark of and going about this palace of Pentheus beat them, so that Kadmos’ city may see. I myself will go to the folds of Kithairon, where the Bacchae are, to share in their dances. From the land of having left sacred Tmolus, I am swift to perform for Bromius my sweet labor and toil easily borne, celebrating the god Bacchus speaking propitious things. For I will celebrate Dionysus with hymns according to eternal custom. Blessed is he who, being fortunate and knowing the rites of the gods, keeps his life pure and has his soul initiated into the Bacchic revels, dancing in inspired frenzy over the mountains with holy purifications, and who, revering the mysteries of great mother Kybele, brandishing the thyrsos, garlanded with ivy, serves Dionysus.\\nGo, Bacchae, go, Bacchae, escorting the god Bromius, child of a god, from the Phrygian mountains to the broad streets of Hellas—Bromius, Whom once, in the compulsion of birth pains, the thunder of Zeus flying upon her, his mother cast from her womb, leaving life by the stroke of a thunderbolt. Immediately Zeus, Kronos’ son, received him in a chamber fit for birth, and having covered him in his thigh shut him up with golden clasps, hidden from Hera.\\nAnd he brought forth, when the Fates had perfected him, the bull-horned god, and he crowned him with crowns of snakes, for which reason Maenads cloak their wild prey over their locks. O or pine. Adorn your garments of spotted fawn-skin with fleeces of white sheep, and sport in holy games with insolent thyrsoi whoever leads the sacred band is Bromius—to the mountain, to the mountain, where the crowd of women waits, goaded away from their weaving by Dionysus. O secret chamber of the Kouretes and you holy Cretan caves, parents to Zeus, where the Korybantes with triple helmet invented for me in their caves this circle, covered with stretched hide; and in their excited revelry they mingled it with the sweet-voiced breath of Phrygian pipes and handed it over to mother Rhea, resounding with the sweet songs of the Bacchae; nearby, raving Satyrs were fulfilling the rites of the mother goddess, and they joined it to the dances of the biennial festivals, in which Dionysus rejoices. He is sweet in the mountains Phrygian, the Lydian mountains, and the leader of the dance is Bromius, evoe! The Bacchic one, raising the flaming torch of pine on his thyrsos, like the smoke of Syrian incense, darts about, arousing the wanderers with his racing and dancing, agitating them with his shouts, casting his rich locks into the air. And among the Maenad cries his voice rings deep: Who is at the gates? Call from the house Kadmos, son of Agenor, who leaving the city of what agreement I, an old man, have made with him, older still: to twine the thyrsoi, to wear fawn-skins, and to crown our heads with ivy branches. Dearest friend, for inside the house I heard and recognized your wise voice, the voice of a wise man; I have come prepared with this equipment of the god. For we must extol him, the child of my daughter, and shake my grey head? Show me the way, Teiresias, one old man leading another; for you are wise. And so I shall never tire night or day striking the ground with the thyrsos. Gladly I have forgotten that I am old. Then you and I have the same feelings, for I too feel young and will try to dance. Then will we go to the mountain in a chariot? But then the god would not have equal honor. I, an old man, will lead you, an old man, like a pupil. The god will lead us there without trouble. Are we the only ones in the city who will dance in Bacchus’ honor? Yes, for we alone think rightly, the rest wrongly. The delay is long; come, take hold of my hand. Here, take hold, and join your hand with mine. Having been born mortal I do not scorn the gods. We mortals have no cleverness in the eyes of the the gods. being about to dance with my head covered in ivy? No, for the god has made no distinction as to whether it is right for men young or old to dance, but wishes to have common honors from all and to be extolled, setting no one apart. Since you do not see this light, Teiresias, I will be your interpreter. Pentheus, child of Echion, to whom I gave control of this land, is coming here to the house now in haste. How fluttered he is! What new matter will he tell us? I happened to be at a distance from this land, when I heard of strange evils throughout this city, that the women have left our homes in contrived Bacchic rites, and rush about in the shadowy mountains, honoring with dances this new deity Dionysus, whoever he is. I hear that mixing-bowls stand full in the midst of their assemblies, and that they each creep off different ways into secrecy to serve the beds of men, on the pretext that they are Maenads worshipping; but they consider Aphrodite before Bacchus.\\nAs many of them as I have caught, servants keep in the public strongholds with their hands bound, and as many as are absent I will hunt from the mountains, fragrant in hair with golden curls, having in his eyes the wine-dark graces of Aphrodite. He is with the young girls day and night, alluring them with joyful mysteries. If I catch him within this house, I will stop him from making a noise with the thyrsos and shaking his hair, by cutting his head off.\\nThat one claims that Dionysus is a god, claims that he was once stitched into the thigh of Zeus—Dionysus, who was burnt up with his mother by the flame of lightning, because she had falsely claimed a marriage with Zeus. Is this not worthy of a terrible death by hanging, for a stranger to insult me with these insults, whoever he is?\\nBut here is another wonder—I see Teiresias the soothsayer in dappled fawn-skins and my mother’s father—a great absurdity—raging about with a thyrsos. I shrink, father, from seeing your old age devoid of sense. Won’t you cast away the ivy? Grandfather, will you not free your hand of the thyrsos? You persuaded him to this, Teiresias. Do you wish, by introducing another new god to men, to examine birds and receive rewards for sacrifices? If your gray old age did not defend you, you would sit in chains in the midst of the Bacchae, for introducing wicked rites. For where women have the delight of the grape-cluster at a feast, I say that none of their rites is healthy any longer. Oh, what impiety! O stranger, do you not reverence the gods and Kadmos who sowed the earth-born crop? Do you, the child of Echion, bring shame to your race? Whenever a wise man takes a good occasion for his speech, it is not a great task to speak well. You have a rapid tongue as though you were sensible, but there is no sense in your words. A man powerful in his boldness, one capable of speaking well, becomes a bad citizen in his lack of sense. This new god, whom you ridicule, I am unable to express how great he will be throughout are first among men: the goddess Demeter—she is the earth, but call her whatever name you wish; she nourishes mortals with dry food; but he who came afterwards, the offspring of Semele, discovered a match to it, the liquid drink of the grape, and introduced it to mortals. It releases wretched mortals from grief, whenever they are filled with the stream of the vine, and gives them sleep, a means of forgetting their daily troubles, nor is there another cure for hardships. He who is a god is poured out in offerings to the gods, so that by his means men may have good things.\\n    And do you laugh at him, because he was sewn up in Zeus’ thigh? I will teach you that this is well: when Zeus snatched him out of the lighting-flame, and led the child as a god to Hera wished to banish him from the sky, but Zeus, as a god, had a counter-contrivance. Having broken a part of the air which surrounds the earth, he gave this to Hera as a pledge mortals say that he was nourished in the thigh of Zeus, changing the word, because a god he had served as a hostage for the goddess Hera, and composing the story. For whenever the god enters a body in full force, he makes the frantic to foretell the future. He also possesses a share of Ares’ nature. For terror sometimes flutters an army under arms and in its ranks before it even touches a spear; and this too is a frenzy from Dionysus. You will see him also on the rocks of do not boast that sovereignty has power among men, nor, even if you think so, and your mind is diseased, believe that you are being at all wise. Receive the god into your land, pour libations to him, celebrate the Bacchic rites, and garland your head.\\nDionysus will not compel women to be modest in regard to Aphrodite, but in nature and the city extols the name of Pentheus. He too, I think, delights in being honored. Kadmos, whom you mock, and I will crown our heads with ivy and dance, a gray yoke-team but still we must dance; and I will not be persuaded by your words to fight against the god. For you are mad in a most grievous way, and you will not be cured by drugs, nor are you sick without them. Old man, you do not shame Phoebus with your words, and honoring Dionysus, a great god, you are prudent. My child, Teiresias has advised you well. Dwell with us, not apart from the laws. For now you flit about and have thoughts without thinking. Even if, as you say, he is not a god, call him one; and tell a glorious falsehood, so that Semele might seem to have borne a god, and honor might come to all our race. You see the wretched fate of Actaeon, who was torn apart in the meadows by the blood-thirsty hounds he had raised, having boasted that he was superior in the hunt to Artemis. May you not suffer this. Come, let me crown your head with ivy; honor the god along with us. Don’t lay a hand on me! Go off and hold your revels, but don’t wipe your foolishness off on me. I will seek the punishment of this teacher of your folly. Let someone go quickly to the seat where he watches the flights of birds, upset and overturn it with levers, turning everything upside down; and release his garlands to the winds and storms. In this way I will especially wound him. And some of you hunt throughout the city for this effeminate stranger, who introduces a new disease to women and pollutes our beds. If you catch him, bring him here bound, so that he might suffer as punishment a death by stoning, having seen a bitter Bacchic revelry in O wretched man, how little you know what you are saying! You are mad now, and even before you were out of your wits. Let us go, Kadmos, and entreat the god, on behalf of him, though he is savage, and on behalf of the city, to do no ill. But follow me with the ivy-clad staff, and try to support my body, and I will try to support yours; it would be shameful for two old men to fall down. But let that pass, for we must serve Bacchus, the son of Zeus. Beware lest Pentheus bring trouble to your house, Kadmos; I do not speak in prophecy, but judging from the state of things; for a foolish man speaks foolishness. Holiness, queen of the gods, Holiness, who bear your golden wings along the earth, do you hear these words from Pentheus? Do you hear his unholy insolence against Bromius, the child of Semele, the first deity of the gods at the banquets where guests wear beautiful garlands? He holds this office, to join in dances, to laugh with the flute, and to bring an end to cares, whenever the delight of the grape comes at the feasts of the gods, and in ivy-bearing banquets the goblet sheds sleep over men. Misfortune is the result of unbridled mouths and lawless folly; but the life of quiet and wisdom remain unshaken and hold houses together. Though they dwell far off in the heavens the gods see the deeds of mortals. But cleverness is not wisdom, nor is thinking on things unfit for mortals. Life is short, and on this account the one who pursues great things does not achieve that which is present. In my opinion, these are the ways of mad and ill-advised men. Would that I could go to mortals’ hearts, dwell, and to to lawful for the Bacchae to celebrate their rites. The god, the son of Zeus, delights in banquets, and loves Peace, giver of riches, goddess who nourishes youths. To the blessed and to the less fortunate, he gives an equal pleasure from wine that banishes grief. He hates the one who does not care about this: to lead a happy life by day and friendly What the common people think and adopt, that would I accept. Pentheus, we are here, having caught this prey for which you sent us, nor have we set out in vain. This beast was docile in our hands and did not withdraw in flight, but yielded not unwillingly. He did not turn pale or change the wine-dark complexion of his cheek, but laughed and allowed us to bind him and lead him away. He remained still, making my work easy, and I in shame said: are set loose and gone, and are gamboling in the meadows, invoking Bromius as their god. Of their own accord, the chains were loosed from their feet and keys opened the doors without human hand. This man has come to full of many wonders. You must take care of the rest. Release his hands, for caught in the nets he is not so swift as to escape me. But your body is not ill-formed, stranger, for women’s purposes, for which reason you have come to For your hair is long, not through wrestling, scattered over your cheeks, full of desire; and you have a white skin from careful preparation, hunting after Aphrodite by your beauty not exposed to strokes of the sun, but beneath the shade. First then tell me who your family is. I can tell you this easily, without boasting. I suppose you are familiar with flowery Tmolus. I know of it; it surrounds the city of I am from there, and Why do you bring these rites to Dionysus, the child of Zeus, sent me. Is there a Zeus who breeds new gods there? No, but the one who married Semele here. Did he compel you at night, or in your sight? Seeing me just as I saw him, he gave me sacred rites. What appearance do your rites have? They can not be told to mortals uninitiated in Bacchic revelry. And do they have any profit to those who sacrifice? It is not lawful for you to hear, but they are worth knowing. You have counterfeited this well, so that I desire to hear. The rites are hostile to whoever practices impiety. Are you saying that you saw clearly what the god was like? He was as he chose; I did not order this. Again you diverted my question well, speaking mere nonsense. One will seem to be foolish if he speaks wisely to an ignorant man. Did you come here first, bringing the god? All the barbarians celebrate these rites. Yes, for they are far more foolish than Hellenes. In this at any rate they are wiser; but their laws are different. Do you perform the rites by night or by day? Mostly by night; darkness conveys awe. This is treacherous towards women, and unsound. Even during the day someone may devise what is shameful. You must pay the penalty for your evil contrivances. And you for your ignorance and impiety toward the god. How bold the Bacchant is, and not unpracticed in speaking! Tell me what I must suffer; what harm will you do to me? First I will cut off your delicate hair. My hair is sacred. I am growing it for the god. Next give me this thyrsos from your hands. Take it from me yourself. I bear it as the ensign of Dionysus. We will guard your body within, in prison. The god himself will release me, whenever I want. Yes, when you call him, standing among the Bacchae. Even now he see my sufferings from close by. Where is he? He is not visible to my eyes. Near me; but you, being impious, do not see him.  I warn you not to bind me, since I am in my senses and you are not. And I, more masterful than you, bid them to bind you. You do not know why you live, or what you are doing, or who you are. I am Pentheus, son of Echion and Agave. You are well-suited to be miserable in your name. Go. stable, so that he may see only darkness. I will go, for I need not suffer that which is not necessary. But Dionysus, who you claim does not exist, will pursue you for these insults. For in injuring us, you put him in bonds. venerable Dirce, happy virgin, you once received the child of Zeus in your streams, when Zeus his father snatched him up from the immortal fire and saved him in his thigh, crying out: But you, blessed Dirce, reject me with my garland-bearing company about you. Why do you refuse me, why do you flee me? I swear by the cluster-bearing delight of Dionysus’ vine that you will have a care for Bromius. What rage, what rage does the earth-born race show, and Pentheus, once descended from a serpent—Pentheus, whom earth-born Echion bore, a fierce monster, not a mortal man, but like a bloody giant, hostile to the gods. He will soon bind me, the hand-maid of Bromius, in chains, and he already holds my fellow-reveler within the house, hidden in a dark prison. Do you see this, O Dionysus, son of Zeus, your priests in the dangers of restraint? Come, lord, down from and restrain the insolence of the blood-thirsty man. Where on Perhaps in the deep-wooded lairs of Blessed whirling Maenads, leaving Lydias, giver of wealth to mortals, the father who they say fertilizes the land of beautiful horses with fairest streams.  Who is here, who? From what quarter did the voice of the Joyful one summon me? Io! Io! I say again; it is I, the child of Zeus and Semele. Io! Io! Master, master! Come now to our company, Bromius. Shake the world’s plain, lady Earthquake! Oh! Oh! Soon the palace of Pentheus will be shaken in ruin. Revere him.\\n—We revere him!\\n—Did you see these stone lintels on the pillars falling apart? Bromius cries out in victory indoors. Light the fiery lamp of lightning! Burn, burn Pentheus’ home! Oh! Oh! Do you not see the the fire, do you not perceive, about the sacred tomb of Semele, the flame that Zeus’ thunderbolt left? Cast on the ground your trembling bodies, Maenads, cast them down, for our lord, Zeus’ son, is coming against this palace, turning everything upside down. Barbarian women, have you fallen on the ground so stricken with fear? You have, so it seems, felt Bacchus shaking the house of Pentheus. But get up and take courage, putting a stop to your trembling. Oh greatest light for us in our joyful revelry, how happy I am to see you—I who was alone and desolate before. Did you despair when I was sent to fall into Pentheus’ dark dungeon? How not? Who was my guardian, if you met with misfortune? But how were you freed, having met with an impious man? By myself I saved myself easily, without trouble. Did he not tie your hands in binding knots? In this too I mocked him, for, thinking to bind me, he neither touched nor handled me, but fed on hope. He found a bull by the stable where he took and shut me up, and threw shackles around its knees and hooves, breathing out fury, dripping sweat from his body, gnashing his teeth in his lips. But I, being near, sitting quietly, looked on. Meanwhile, Bacchus came and shook the house and kindled a flame on his mother’s tomb. When Pentheus saw this, thinking that the house was burning, he ran here and there, calling to the slaves to bring water, and every servant was at work, toiling in vain.\\nThen he let this labor drop, as I had escaped, and snatching a dark sword rushed into the house. Then Bromius, so it seems to me—I speak my opinion— created a phantom in the courtyard. Pentheus rushed at it headlong, stabbing at the shining air, as though slaughtering me. Besides this, Bacchus inflicted other damage on him: he knocked his house to the ground, and everything was shattered into pieces, while he saw my bitter chains. From fatigue, dropping his sword, he is exhausted. For he, a man, dared to join battle with a god. Now I have quietly left the house and come to you, with no thought of Pentheus.\\nBut I think—at any rate I hear the tramping of feet inside—he will soon come to the front of the house. What will he say after this? I shall easily bear him, even if he comes boasting greatly. For it is the part of a wise man to practice restrained good temper. I have suffered terrible things; the stranger, who was recently constrained in bonds, has escaped me. Ah! Here is the man. What is this? How do you appear in front of my house, having come out? Stop, and put a stop to your anger. How have you escaped your chains and come outside? Did I not say—or did you not hear—that some one would deliver me? Who? You are always introducing strange explanations. He who produces the rich-clustering vine for mortals. You reproach Dionysus for what is his glory. I order you to close up all the towers around. Why? Do gods not pass over walls too? You are wise, wise at least in all save what you should be wise in. I was born wise in all that I should be. Pentheus, ruler of this land of What important news do you come to bring? Having seen the holy Bacchae, who goaded to madness have darted from this land with their fair feet, I have come to tell you and the city, lord, that they are doing terrible things, beyond marvel. I wish to hear whether I should tell you in free speech the situation there or whether I should repress my report, for I fear, lord, the quickness of your mood, your keen temper and your too imperious disposition. Speak, as you will have immunity from me in any case. For it is not right to be angry with the just. The more you tell me terrible things about the Bacchae, the more I will punish this one here who taught the women these tricks. The herds of grazing cattle were just climbing up the hill, at the time when the sun sends forth its rays, warming the earth. I saw three companies of dancing women, one of which Autonoe led, the second your mother Agave, and the third Ino. All were asleep, their bodies relaxed, some resting their backs against pine foliage, others laying their heads at random on the oak leaves, modestly, not as you say drunk with the goblet and the sound of the flute, hunting out Aphrodite through the woods in solitude.\\nYour mother raised a cry, standing up in the midst of the Bacchae, to wake their bodies from sleep, when she heard the lowing of the horned cattle. And they, casting off refreshing sleep from their eyes, sprang upright, a marvel of orderliness to behold, old, young, and still unmarried virgins. First they let their hair loose over their shoulders, and secured their fawn-skins, as many of them as had released the fastenings of their knots, girding the dappled hides with serpents licking their jaws. And some, holding in their arms a gazelle or wild wolf-pup, gave them white milk, as many as had abandoned their new-born infants and had their breasts still swollen. They put on garlands of ivy, and oak, and flowering yew. One took her thyrsos and struck it against a rock, from which a dewy stream of water sprang forth. Another let her thyrsos strike the ground, and there the god sent forth a fountain of wine. All who desired the white drink scratched the earth with the tips of their fingers and obtained streams of milk; and a sweet flow of honey dripped from their ivy thyrsoi; so that, had you been present and seen this, you would have approached with prayers the god whom you now blame.\\nWe herdsmen and shepherds gathered in order to debate with one another concerning what strange and amazing things they were doing. Some one, a wanderer about the city and practised in speaking, said to us all: calling on Iacchus, the son of Zeus, Bromius, with united voice. The whole mountain revelled along with them and the beasts, and nothing was unmoved by their running. abandoning the ambush where I had hidden myself. But she cried out: from being torn apart by the Bacchae, but they, with unarmed hands, sprang on the heifers browsing the grass. and you might see one rending asunder a fatted lowing calf, while others tore apart cows. You might see ribs or cloven hooves tossed here and there; caught in the trees they dripped, dabbled in gore. Bulls who before were fierce, and showed their fury with their horns, stumbled to the ground, dragged down by countless young hands. The garment of flesh was torn apart faster then you could blink your royal eyes. And like birds raised in their course, they proceeded along the level plains, which by the streams of the Asopus produce the bountiful Theban crop. And falling like soldiers upon Hysiae and Erythrae, towns situated below the rock of Kithairon, they turned everything upside down. They were snatching children from their homes; and whatever they put on their shoulders, whether bronze or iron, was not held on by bonds, nor did it fall to the ground. They carried fire on their locks, but it did not burn them. Some people in rage took up arms, being plundered by the Bacchae, and the sight of this was terrible to behold, lord. For their pointed spears drew no blood, but the women, hurling the thyrsoi from their hands, kept wounding them and turned them to flight—women did this to men, not without the help of some god. And they returned where they had come from, to the very fountains which the god had sent forth for them, and washed off the blood, and snakes cleaned the drops from the women’s cheeks with their tongues.\\nReceive this god then, whoever he is, into this city, master. For he is great in other respects, and they say this too of him, as I hear, that he gives to mortals the vine that puts an end to grief. Without wine there is no longer Aphrodite or any other pleasant thing for men. I fear to speak freely to the king, but I will speak nevertheless: Dionysus is inferior to none of the gods. Already like fire does this insolence of the Bacchae blaze up, a great reproach for the Hellenes. But we must not hesitate. Go to the Electran gates, bid all the shield-bearers and riders of swift-footed horses to assemble, as well as all who brandish the light shield and pluck bowstrings with their hands, so that we can make an assault against the Bacchae. For it is indeed too much if we suffer what we are suffering at the hands of women. Pentheus, though you hear my words, you obey not at all. Though I suffer ill at your hands, still I say that it is not right for you to raise arms against a god, but to remain calm. Bromius will not allow you to remove the Bacchae from the joyful mountains. Do not instruct me, but be content in your escape from prison. Or shall I bring punishment upon you again? I would sacrifice to the god rather than kick against his spurs in anger, a mortal against a god. I will sacrifice, making a great slaughter of the women, as they deserve, in the glens of Kithairon. You will all flee. And it will be a source of shame that you turn your bronze shields away from the thyrsoi of the Bacchae. This stranger with whom I am locked together is impossible, and neither suffering nor doing will he be quiet. My friend, there is still opportunity to arrange these things well. Doing what? Being a slave to my slaves? Without weapons I will bring the women here. Alas! You are contriving this as a trick against me. What sort, if I wish to save you by my contrivances? You have devised this together, so that you may have your revelry forever. I certainly did—that is so—with the god.  Ah! Do you wish to see them sitting together in the mountains? Certainly. I’d give an enormous amount of gold for that. Why do you desire this so badly? I would be sorry to see them in their drunkenness. But would you see gladly what is grievous to you? To be sure, sitting quietly under the pines. But they will track you down, even if you go in secret. You are right: I will go openly. Shall I guide you? Will you attempt the journey? Lead me as quickly as possible. I grudge you the time. Put linen clothes on your body then. What is this? Shall I then, instead of a man, be reckoned among the women? Lest they kill you if you are seen there as a man. Again you speak correctly: how wise you have been all along! Dionysus taught me these things fully. How can your advice to me be well carried out? I will go inside and dress you. In what clothing? Female? But shame holds me back. Are you no longer eager to view the maenads? What clothing do you bid me to put on my body? I will spread out hair at length on your head. What is the second part of my outfit? A robe down to your feet. And you will wear a headband. And what else will you add to this for me? A thyrsos in your hand, and a dappled fawn-skin. I could not put on a woman’s dress. But you will shed blood if you join battle with the Bacchae. True. We must go first and spy. This is at any rate wiser than hunting trouble with trouble. And how will I go through the city without being seen by the Thebans? We will go on deserted roads. I will lead you. Anything is better than to be mocked by the Bacchae. We two will go into the house . . . and I will consider what seems best. It will be so; in any case I am ready. I will go in. For either I will go bearing arms, or I will obey your counsels. Women, the man is caught in our net. He will go to the Bacchae, where he will pay the penalty with his death. Dionysus, now it is your job; for you are not far off. Let us punish him. First drive him out of his wits, send upon him a dizzying madness, since if he is of sound mind he will not consent to wear women’s clothing, but driven out of his senses he will put it on. I want him to be a source of laughter to the Thebans, led through the city in women’s guise after making such terrible threats in the past. But now I will go to fit on Pentheus the dress he will wear to the house of Hades, slaughtered by his mother’s hands. He will recognize the son of Zeus, Dionysus, who is in fact a god, the most terrible and yet most mild to men. Shall I move my white foot in the night-long dance, aroused to a frenzy, throwing my head to the dewy air, like a fawn sporting in the green pleasures of the meadow, when it has escaped a fearful chase beyond the watchers over the well-woven nets, and the hunter hastens his dogs on their course with his call, while she, with great exertion and a storm-swift running, rushes along the plain by the river, rejoicing in the solitude apart from men and in the thickets of the shady-foliaged woods.\\nWhat is wisdom? Or what greater honor do the gods give to mortals than to hold one’s hand in strength over the head of enemies? What is good is always dear. Divine strength is roused with difficulty, but still is sure. It chastises those mortals who honor folly and those who in their insanity do not extol the gods. The gods cunningly conceal the long pace of time and hunt the impious. For it is not right to determine or plan anything beyond the laws. For it is a light expense to hold that whatever is divine has power, and that which has been law for a long time is eternal and has its origin in nature.\\nWhat is wisdom? Or what greater honor do the gods give to mortals than to hold one’s hand in strength over the head of enemies? What is good is always dear. Happy is he One surpass another in different ways, in wealth or power. There are innumerable hopes to innumerable men, and some result in wealth to mortals, while others fail. But I call him blessed whose life is happy day to day. You who are eager to see what you ought not and hasty in pursuit of what ought not to be pursued—I mean you, Pentheus, come forth before the house, be seen by me, wearing the clothing of a woman, of an inspired maenad, a spy upon your mother and her company. Oh look! I think I see two suns, and twin And you seem to lead me, being like a bull and horns seem to grow on your head. But were you ever before a beast? For you have certainly now become a bull. The god accompanies us, now at truce with us, though formerly not propitious. Now you see what you should see. How do I look? Don’t I have the posture of Ino, or of my mother Agave? Looking at you I think I see them. But this lock of your hair has come out of place, not the way I arranged it under your headband. I displaced it indoors, shaking my head forwards and backwards and practising my Bacchic revelry. But I who ought to wait on you will re-arrange it. Hold up your head. Here, you arrange it; for I depend on you, indeed. Your girdle has come loose, and the pleats of your gown do not extend regularly down around your ankles. At least on my right leg, I believe they don’t. But on this side the robe sits well around the back of my leg. You will surely consider me the best of your friends, when contrary to your expectation you see the Bacchae acting modestly. But shall I be more like a maenad holding the thyrsos in my right hand, or in my left? You must hold it in your right hand and raise your right foot in unison with it. I praise you for having changed your mind. Could I carry on my shoulders the glens of Kithairon, Bacchae and all? You could if you were willing. The state of mind you had before was unsound, but now you think as you ought. Shall we bring levers? Or shall I draw them up with my hands, putting a shoulder or arm under the mountain-tops? But don’t destroy the seats of the Nymphs and the places where Pan plays his pipes. Well said. The women are not to be taken by force; I will hide in the pines. You will hide yourself as you should be hidden, coming as a crafty spy on the Maenads. Oh, yes! I imagine that like birds they are in the bushes held in the sweetest grips of love. You have been sent as a guard against this very event. Perhaps you will catch them, if you yourself are not caught before. Bring me through the midst of the Theban land. I am the only man of them who dares to perform this deed. You alone bear the burden for this city, you alone. Therefore the labors which are proper await you. Follow me. I am your saving guide: another will lead you down from there. Yes, my mother. And you will be remarkable to all. I am going for this reason. You will return here being carried— You talk of a delicacy for me. In the arms of your mother. You will force me to luxury. Yes indeed, such luxury! I will get what I deserve. You are terrible, terrible, and you go to terrible sufferings, so that you will find a renown reaching to heaven. Reach out your hands, Agave, and you too, her sisters, daughters of Kadmos. I lead this young man to a great contest, and Bromius and I will be the victors. The rest the matter itself will show. Go to the mountain, go, fleet hounds of Madness, where the daughters of Kadmos hold their company, and drive them raving against the mad spy on the Maenads, the one dressed in women’s attire. His mother will be the first to see him from a smooth rock or crag, as he lies in ambush, and she will cry out to the maenads: this godless, lawless, unjust, earth-born offspring of Echion. Whoever with wicked mind and unjust rage regarding your rites, Bacchus, and those of your mother, comes with raving heart and mad disposition violently to overcome by force what is invincible—death is the discipline for his purposes, accepting no excuses when the affairs of the gods are concerned; to act like a mortal—this is a life that is free from pain. I do not envy wisdom, but rejoice in hunting it. But other things are great and manifest. Oh, for life to flow towards the good, to be pure and pious day and night, and to honor the gods, banishing customs that are outside of justice.\\nLet manifest justice go forth, let it go with sword in hand, slaying through the throat this godless, lawless, unjust, earth-born offspring of Echion. Appear as a bull or many-headed serpent or raging lion to see. Go, Bacchus, with smiling face throw a deadly noose around the hunter of the Bacchae as he falls beneath the flock of Maenads. Oh house once fortunate in house of the Sidonian old man who once sowed in the ground the earth-born harvest of the serpent Ophis, how I groan for you, though I am a slave, but still What is it? Do you bring some news from the Bacchae? Pentheus, the child of Echion, is dead. Lord Bacchus, truly you appear to be a great god. What do you mean? Why have you said this? Do you rejoice at the misfortunes of my master, woman? I, a foreign woman, rejoice with foreign songs; for no longer do I cower in fear of chains. Do you think Dionysus, Dionysus, not You may be forgiven, but still it is not good to rejoice at troubles once they have actually taken place, women. Tell me, speak, what kind of a death did he die, the unjust man who did unjust things? When we left the dwellings of the Theban land and crossed the streams of Asopus, we began to ascend the heights of Kithairon, Pentheus and I—for I was following my master—and the stranger who was our guide to the sight. First we sat in a grassy vale, keeping our feet and voices quiet, so that we might see them without being seen. There was a little valley surounded by precipices, irrigated with streams, shaded by pine trees, where the Maenads were sitting, their hands busy with delightful labors. Some of them were crowning again the worn thyrsos, making it leafy with ivy, while some, like colts freed from the painted yoke, were singing a Bacchic melody to one another. And the unhappy Pentheus said, not seeing the crowd of women: he pulled it down, pulled it, pulled it to the dark earth. It was bent just as a bow or a curved wheel, when it is marked out by a compass, describes a circular course He sat Pentheus down on the pine branch, and let it go upright through his hands steadily, taking care not to shake him off. The pine stood firmly upright into the sky, with my master seated on its back. He was seen by the Maenads more than he saw them, for sitting on high he was all but apparent, and the stranger was no longer anywhere to be seen, when a voice, Dionysus as I guess, cried out from the air: kept its leaves silent, nor would you have heard the sounds of animals. But they, not having heard the sound clearly, stood upright and looked all around. He repeated his order, and when the daughters of Kadmos recognized the clear command of Bacchus, they rushed forth, swift as a dove, running with eager speed of feet, his mother Agave, and her sisters, and all the Bacchae. They leapt through the torrent-streaming valley and mountain cliffs, frantic with the inspiration of the god. When they saw my master sitting in the pine, first they climbed a rock towering opposite the tree and began to hurl at him boulders violently thrown. Some aimed with pine branches and other women hurled their thyrsoi through the air at Pentheus, a sad target indeed. But they did not reach him, for the wretched man, caught with no way out, sat at a height too great for their eagerness. Finally like lightning they smashed oak branches and began to tear up the roots of the tree with ironless levers. When they did not succeed in their toils, Agave said: to the pine and dragged it up from the earth. Pentheus fell crashing to the ground from his lofty seat, wailing greatly: for he knew he was in terrible trouble. and fell upon him. He threw the headband from his head so that the wretched Agave might recognize and not kill him. Touching her cheek, he said: Seizing his left arm at the elbow and propping her foot against the unfortunate man’s side, she tore out his shoulder, not by her own strength, but the god gave facility to her hands. Ino began to work on the other side, tearing his flesh, while Autonoe and the whole crowd of the Bacchae pressed on. All were making noise together, he groaning as much as he had life left in him, while they shouted in victory. One of them bore his arm, another a foot, boot and all. His ribs were stripped bare from their tearings. The whole band, hands bloodied, were playing a game of catch with Pentheus’ flesh.\\nHis body lies in different places, part under the rugged rocks, part in the deep foliage of the woods, not easy to be sought. His miserable head, which his mother happened to take in her hands, she fixed on the end of a thyrsos and carries through the midst of Kithairon like that of a savage lion, leaving her sisters among the Maenads’ dances. She is coming inside these walls, preening herself on the ill-fated prey, calling Bacchus her fellow hunter, her accomplice in the chase, the glorious victor—in whose service she wins a triumph of tears.\\nAnd as for me, I will depart out of the way of this calamity before Agave reaches the house. Soundness of mind and reverence for the affairs of the gods is best; and this, I think, is the wisest possession for those mortals who adopt it. Let us honor Bacchus with the dance, let us raise a shout for what has befallen Pentheus, descendant of the serpent, who assumed female attire and the wand, the beautiful thyrsos—certain death—and a bull was the leader of his calamity. Kadmean Bacchae, you have accomplished a glorious victory, but one that brings woe and tears. It is a noble contest to cover one’s dripping hands with the blood of one’s own son. But, for I see Pentheus’ mother Agave coming home, her eyes contorted, receive the revel of the god of joy! Asian Bacchae— Why do you excite me, oh? I am bringing home from the mountain a freshly cut tendril to the house, blessed prey. I see it and will accept you as a fellow reveler. I caught this young wild lion cub without snares, as you can see. From what desert? Kithairon— Kithairon? Slew him. Who struck him? The honor is mine first. I am called blessed Agave in the revels. Who else? Kadmos’— Kadmos’ what? His other offspring took hold of this beast after me, after me. This is a lucky catch! Share in the feast then. What? I share in the feast, wretched woman? The bull is young; his cheek is just growing downy under his soft-haired crest. Yes, his hair looks like a wild beast’s. Bacchus, a wise huntsman, wisely set the Maenads against this beast. Our lord is a hunter. Do you praise me? I praise you. Soon the Kadmeans— And your son Pentheus, too— Will praise his mother who has caught this lion-like prey. Extraordinary. And extraordinarily caught. Are you proud? I am delighted, for I have performed great—yes, great—and notable deeds on this hunt. Now show the citizens, wretched woman, the booty which you have brought in victory. You who dwell in this fair-towered city of the Theban land, come to see this prey which we the daughters of Kadmos hunted down, not with thonged Thessalian javelins, or with nets, but with the fingers of our white arms. And then should huntsmen boast and use in vain the work of spear-makers? But we caught and tore apart the limbs of this beast with our very own hands. Where is my old father? Let him approach. And where is my son Pentheus? Let him take a ladder and raise its steps against the house so that he can fasten to the triglyphs this lion’s head which I have captured and brought here. Follow me, carrying the miserable burden of Pentheus, follow me, slaves, before the house; exhausted from countless searches, I am bringing his body, for I discovered it in the folds of Kithairon, torn apart; I picked up nothing in the same place, and it was lying in the woods where discovery was difficult. For some one told me of my daughters’ bold deeds, when I had already come within the walls of the city on my return from the Bacchae with old Teiresias. I turned back to the mountain and now bring here my child who was killed by the Maenads. For I saw Autonoe, who once bore Actaeon to Aristaeus, and Ino with her, still mad in the thicket, wretched creatures. But some one told me that Agave was coming here with Bacchic foot, and this was correct, for I see her—no happy sight! Father, you may make a great boast, that you have born daughters the best by far of all mortals. I mean all of us, but myself especially, who have left my shuttle at the loom and gone on to greater things, to catch wild animals with my two hands. And having taken him, I carry these spoils of honor in my arms, as you see, so that they may hang from your house. You father, receive them in your hands. Preening yourself in my catch, call your friends to a feast. For you are blessed, blessed, now that we have performed these deeds. O grief beyond measuring, one which I cannot stand to see, that you have performed murder with miserable hands. Having cast down a fine sacrificial victim to the gods, you invite lord Bromius the god has destroyed us, though he is a member of our own family. How morose and sullen in its countenance is man’s old age! I hope that my son is a good hunter, taking after his mother’s ways, when he goes after wild beasts together with the young men of Alas, alas! When you realize what you have done you will suffer a terrible pain. But if you remain forever in the state you are in now, though hardly fortunate, you will not imagine that you are unfortunate. But what of these matters is not right, or what is painful? First cast your eye up to this sky. All right; why do you tell me to look at it? Is it still the same, or does it appear to have changed? It is brighter than before and more translucent. Is your soul still quivering? I don’t understand your words. I have become somehow sobered, changing from my former state of mind. Can you hear and respond clearly? Yes, for I forget what we said before, father. To whose house did you come in marriage? You gave me, as they say, to Echion, the sown man. What son did you bear to your husband in the house? Pentheus, from my union with his father. Whose head do you hold in your hands? A lion’s, as they who hunted him down said. Examine it correctly then; it takes but little effort to see. Ah! What do I see? What is this that I carry in my hands? Look at it and learn more clearly. I see the greatest grief, wretched that I am. Does it seem to you to be like a lion? No, but I, wretched, hold the head of Pentheus. Yes, much lamented before you recognized him. Who killed him? How did he come into my hands? Miserable truth, how inopportunely you arrive! Tell me. My heart leaps at what is to come. You and your sisters killed him. Where did he die? Was it here at home, or in what place? Where formerly dogs divided Actaeon among themselves. And why did this ill-fated man go to Kithairon? He went to mock the god and your revelry. But in what way did we go there? You were mad, and the whole city was frantic with Bacchus. Dionysus destroyed us—now I understand. Being insulted with insolence, for you did not consider him a god. And where is the body of my dearest child, father? I have traced it with difficulty and brought it back. Are its joints laid properly together? What part did Pentheus have in my folly? He, like you, did not revere the god, who therefore joined all in one ruin, both you and this one here, and thus destroyed the house and me, , who am bereft of my male children and see this offspring of your womb, wretched woman, most miserably and shamefully slain. He was the hope of our line—you, child, who supported the house, son of my daughter, an object of fear to the city; seeing you, no one wished to insult the old man, for you would have given a worthy punishment. But now I, great Kadmos, who sowed and reaped a most glorious crop, the Theban people, will be banished from the house without honor. Dearest of men—for though you are dead I still count you among my dearest, child—no longer will you embrace me, calling me grandfather, touching my chin with your hand, child, and saying: If anyone scorns the gods, let him look to the death of this man and acknowledge them. I grieve for you, Kadmos. Your daughter’s child has a punishment deserved indeed, but grievous to you. Father, for you see how much my situation has changed ... . . . changing your form, you will become a dragon, and your wife, Harmonia, Ares’ daughter, whom you though mortal held in marriage, will be turned into a beast, and will receive in exchange the form of a serpent. And as the oracle of Zeus says, you will drive along with your wife a chariot of heifers, ruling over barbarians. You will sack many cities with a force of countless numbers. And when they plunder the oracle of Apollo, they will have a miserable return, but Ares will protect you and Harmonia and will settle your life in the land of the blessed. That is what I, Dionysus, born not from a mortal father, but from Zeus, say. And if you had known how to be wise when you did not wish to be, you would have acquired Zeus’ son as an ally, and would now be happy. Dionysus, we beseech you, we have acted injustly. You have learned it too late; you did not know it when you should have. Now we know, but you go too far against us. Yes, for I, a god by birth, was insulted by you. Gods should not resemble mortals in their anger. My father Zeus approved this long ago. Alas! A miserable exile has been decreed for us, old man. Why then do you delay what must necessarily be? Child, what a terrible disaster we have all come to—unhappy you, your sisters, and unhappy me. I shall reach a foreign land as an aged immigrant. Still it is foretold that I shall bring into I will neither rest from my troubles in my misery, nor will I sail over the downward flowing O father, I will go into exile deprived of you. Why do you embrace me with your hands, child, like a swan for its exhausted gray-haired parent? For where can I turn, banished from my father-land? I do not know, child; your father is a poor ally. Farewell, house, farewell, city of my forefathers. In misfortune I leave you, a fugitive from my chamber. Go now, child, to the land of Aristaeus . . . I grieve for you, father. And I for you, child, and I weep for your sisters. Terribly indeed has lord Dionysus brought this misery to your home. Yes, for I suffered terrible things at your hands, with my name not honored in Farewell, my father. Farewell, unhappy daughter; and yet you cannot easily fare well. Lead me, escorts, where I may take my pitiful sisters as companions to my exile. May I go where accursed Kithairon may not see me, nor I see Kithairon with my eyes, nor where a memorial of a thyrsos has been dedicated; let these concern other Bacchae. Many are the forms of divine things, and the gods bring to pass many things unexpectedly; what is expected has not been accomplished, but the god has found out a means for doing things unthought of. So too has this event turned out.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        O ancient plain of land, the streams of Inachus, from which king Agamemnon once mounted war on a thousand ships and sailed to the land of and captured the famous city of Dardanus, he came here to and the hand of Aegisthus, son of Thyestes. And he left behind the ancient scepter of Tantalus, and is dead; but Aegisthus rules the land, possessing Agamemnon’s wife, the daughter of Tyndareus. Now as for those whom he left in his house when he sailed to his son Orestes and his young daughter Electra: when Orestes was about to die at the hand of Aegisthus, his father’s old servant stole him away and gave him to Strophius to bring up in the land of the Phocians. Electra stayed in her father’s house, and when she came to the blooming season of youth, the foremost suitors of the land of When even this filled him with great fear, that she might secretly bear children to some noble lord, Aegisthus planned to kill her, but her mother, although cruel at heart, rescued her from his hand. For she had a pretext for having slain her husband, but she feared that she would be despised for the murder of her children. So then, for these reasons, Aegisthus devised such a scheme: he promised gold to anyone who should kill Agamemnon’s son, who had left the country as an exile, while Electra he gave in marriage to me. My ancestors were Mycenaeans; in that respect at least I am not to blame. My family was noble in race but poor in money—which is the ruin of good birth. He gave her to a powerless man so that his fear might lose its power. For if some man of high position got her, he would have roused the sleeping blood of Agamemnon and judgment would have come at some time to Aegisthus. But I have never (Cypris knows this too) dishonored her in bed; she is still a virgin indeed. I am ashamed to have the daughter of a wealthy man and violate her, when I was not born of equal rank. And I groan for the wretched Orestes, called my kinsman, if he shall ever return to And whoever says I am a fool if I do not touch a young girl when I have her in my house, let him know that he measures soundness of mind by worthless standards of judgment, and he himself is a fool. O black night, nurse of the golden stars, in which I go to the river’s streams, bearing this pitcher resting on my head—not because I have come to such a point of necessity, but so that I may show to the gods Aegisthus’ insolence—and send forth laments into the wide sky, to my father. For the deadly daughter of Tyndareus, my mother, has cast me out of the house to please her husband; since she has borne other children in her union with Aegisthus, she considers Orestes and me secondary in the home. Why, unhappy one, do you do this work, laboring for my sake, though you were well brought up before, and do not stop, even when I tell you this? I hold you equal to the gods in kindness, for in my distress you have not insulted me. It is a great allotment for mortals to find a healer for ill fortune, such as I have in you. And so, even though unbidden, I ought to share your labors, relieving you of work as far as I have strength, so that you may bear it more easily. You have enough to do outside; I must keep the house in order. It is pleasant for the worker coming in from outside to find things within right. Go, then, if you wish; and in fact the springs are not far from my house. When it is day, I will drive the oxen to my lands and sow the fields. For no idler, though he has the gods’ names always on his lips, can gather a livelihood without hard work. Pylades, I hold you first among men as a kind and trusted friend to me. You alone of my friends have honored me, Orestes, being as I am in dreadful suffering from Aegisthus, who killed my father, he and my most deadly mother. I have come from the mystic shrine of the god to During this past night, going to my father’s tomb, I wept and cut off a lock of my hair as an offering and sacrificed over the altar the blood of a slaughtered sheep, unnoticed by the tyrants who rule this land. And now I do not set foot within the walls, but I have come to the borders of this land combining two desires: I may escape to another country if anyone on the watch should recognize me; and, looking for my sister (for they say that she lives here, joined in marriage, and is no longer a virgin), I may meet with her and, having her as an accomplice for murder, I may learn clearly what is happening within the walls. And now, since dawn is lifting up her bright eye, let us step aside from this path. For either some plowman or serving maid will come in our sight, from whom we may ask if my sister lives in this place. But now that I see this maidservant, bearing a weight of water on her shorn head, let us sit down, and inquire of this slave girl, if we may receive some word about the matter, Pylades, for which we have come to this land. Hasten your step, it is time; go onward, onward, weeping! Ah me! I am Agamemnon’s child, and Clytemnestra, hated daughter of Tyndareus, bore me; the citizens call me unhappy Electra. Alas for my cruel pain and hateful life! O father, Agamemnon, you lie in Hades, by the butchery of your wife and Aegisthus. Come, waken the same lament, take up the enjoyment of long weeping. Hasten your step, it is time; go onward, onward, weeping. Ah me! In what city and what household do you wander about, my wretched brother, leaving your pitiable sister in our ancestral home, to great pain? Come to me, the unhappy one, as a deliverer from this pain, oh Zeus, Zeus, and as a defender for my father against his most hateful bloodshed; bring the wanderer to shore in Take this pitcher from my head and put it down, so that I may cry aloud the night-time laments for my father. A wail, a song of death, of death, for you, father, under the earth, I speak the laments in which I am always engaged, day by day, tearing my skin with my nails, and striking my cropped head with my hand, for your death. Oh, oh, tear my face; as a clear-sounding swan beside the river’s streams calls to its dearest father, dying in the crafty snares of the net, so I lament you, my unhappy father, washed by the very last bath, in the most piteous bed of death. Oh, me, your bitter cleaving by the axe, father, the bitter plans of the way from making you the mournful victim of Aigisthus, she got a treacherous bed-fellow. O Electra, daughter of Agamemnon, I have come to your rustic courtyard. A milk-drinker from a mountain walker; he reports that the Argives are proclaiming a sacrifice for the third day from now, and that all maidens are to go to Hera’s temple. My unhappy heart beats fast, friends, but not at adornment or gold; nor will I set up choruses with the maidens of and beat my foot in the mazes of the dance. By tears I pass the night; tears are my unhappy care day by day. See if my filthy hair, and the rags of my dress, will be fit for a princess, a daughter of Agamemnon, or for Mighty is the goddess; come then, and borrow from me thick-woven clothes to wear, and gold—as a favor to me—accessories to adornment. Do you think to rule over your enemies by tears, if you do not revere the gods? Honoring the gods not by lamentation but by prayers, you will have good fortune, child. No god attends to the voice of the ill-fated one, or to the slaying of my father long ago. Alas for the dead, and for the living vagabond, who dwells in another land somewhere, miserably wandering to a slave’s hearth, yet born of that renowned father. I myself live in a poor man’s house, wasting my life away, an exile from my father’s house, on the mountain crags. But my mother, with a new husband, makes her home in a bed stained by blood. Helen, your mother’s sister, is the cause of many evils to the Hellenes and to your house. Ah! Women, I have broken off my lament; strangers, who had their lair at the altar, are rising from ambush towards the household. Let us escape the villains by flight, you along the path and I to the house. Stay, poor girl; do not fear my hand. O Phoebus Apollo! I beseech you to spare my life. May I kill others more hated than you! Go away! Do not touch one whom you must not touch. There is no one I have a better right to touch. Then why are you in ambush, with drawn sword, near my house? Wait and hear, and you will soon say the same. I am still; in any case, I am yours, since you are the stronger. I have come to bring you word from your brother. Oh best of friends! Is he alive or dead? Alive; for I want to tell you the good news first. May you be happy, as a reward for your most welcome tidings. I give that blessing for us two to have in common. Where does the unhappy one live, in his unhappy exile? He goes miserably about, not following the customs of any one city. Surely he does not want for a living, day by day? He has that, but an exile is a helpless man at best. What is this message you have come bringing from him? If you are alive, and if so, how you are. Well then, you see first of all how withered my body is. Yes, so wasted with sorrow that I sigh for it. And my head and hair, close shaven as if by a Scythian’s razor. Your brother and your dead father perhaps gnaw at your heart. Alas! For what is dearer to me than they? Ah! What are you to your brother, do you think? He is far away, not here to be my friend. Why are you living here, far from the city? I am married, stranger; a deadly match. I pity your brother. Is your husband a Mycenaean? Not one to whom my father ever hoped to give me. Tell me so that I may hear and inform your brother. I live in his house, at a distance from the city. A ditch-digger or a herdsman is worthy of the house. He is a man poor but noble, and respectful to me. What is this respect that your husband has? He has never dared to touch me in bed. Does he hold some form of religious chastity, or does he think you unworthy? He did not think himself worthy to insult my family. And how was he not delighted to make such a marriage? He thinks the person who gave me did not have that right, stranger. I understand; he fears that he may someday be punished by Orestes. He does fear that, but he is also a virtuous man. Ah! You have described a noble man, and he must be treated well. Yes, if ever the one now absent comes home. But did your mother, who gave you birth, endure this? Women love their husbands, stranger, not their children. Why did Aegisthus insult you in this way? He planned for me to bear powerless children, when he gave me to such a man. So that you might not bear sons to punish him, of course? That was his plan; may he make amends to me for it! Does your mother’s husband know that you are a virgin? He does not know; we steal that from him by our silence. Are these women who hear our talk friends of yours ? They will keep both your words and mine well hidden. What then could Orestes do in this matter if he comes to Do you ask this? You have said a shameful word; isn’t it the critical time now? But if he does come, how might he kill his father’s murderers? By daring such things as his enemies dared against my father. And would you dare, with him, to kill your mother? Yes, with that same axe by which my father died. Am I to tell him this, and that your purpose is steadfast? Once I had shed my mother’s blood, I might die! Ah! Would that Orestes were near by, to hear that! But, stranger, I would not know him if I saw him. No wonder, for you were both young when you were parted. There is only one of my friends who would recognize him. The man who is said to have stolen him away from murder? Yes, the old man, my father’s old servant. Did the dead man, your father, find burial? He found what he could, cast out of the house. Alas, the things you have said! For perception of suffering, even another’s, gnaws at mortals. Speak, so that when I know, I may tell your brother the story, unpleasant, but necessary to hear. Pity is not present at all in clownishness, but in wise men. And indeed it is not without mischief for the wise to have overly profound thoughts. And I have the same desire in my heart as this man. Being far from the town, I do not know the city’s scandals, and now I want to learn them. I will speak, if I must—and one must speak to a friend—about my own and my father’s heavy misfortunes. Since you are setting the tale in motion, I entreat you, stranger, tell Orestes of our sorrows, mine and his. First of all, in what clothes I live like a beast in a stall, with what filth I am weighted down, under what roof I dwell, having lived in a royal home; I myself working hard on my clothes at the loom, or else I shall go barely clad and do without; always carrying water from the springs myself, with no share in the festival rites, no part in the dance. I turn away from married women, as a virgin; and I turn away from Castor, who sought me in marriage before he joined the gods, for I was his relative. But my mother, in the spoils of is seated on her throne, and at her chair stand slaves from mounts the same chariot and goes forth; and is proud to hold in his blood-stained hands the scepter with which my father used to command the Hellenes. Agamemnon’s grave, dishonoured, has not yet ever received any libations, or branch of myrtle, but his altar is barren of ornament. That famous one, my mother’s husband, leaps on the grave, they say, when soaked in drink, and pelts my father’s marble monument with stones, and dares to say this to us: my shorn head, and his own father. For it is shameful, if his father exterminated the Trojans but Orestes is unable to kill a man, one against one, being young and born from a more noble father. And look, I see him, I mean your husband, on his way home, his day’s work done. Oh! who are these strangers I see at my door? Why have they come here to my rustic gate? Do they want something from me? For it is shameful for a woman to be standing with young men. Dearest, do not be suspicious of me; you shall hear the truth; for these strangers have come to me as messengers of news from Orestes. But, strangers, pardon him for what he said. What do they say? The man is alive and sees the light of day? He is, at least in their report, and I believe them. Surely then he remembers something of your father’s wrongs and your own? These are things to hope for; a man in exile is powerless. What message from Orestes have they come to declare? He sent them as spies of my wrongs. Then they see a part of it, and perhaps you are telling them the rest. They know; they have all these things in abundance. Then shouldn’t you have opened the doors to them long before? Go into the house; for in return for your good tidings, you shall find as much hospitality as my house holds in store. Servants, take their baggage within the house. Do not contradict me, since you are friends coming from a friend; for, even if I am poor, I will not display manners that are ill-bred. By the gods! Is this the man who makes a fraud of your marriage, because he does not want to shame Orestes? This is the one who is called my husband, unhappy as I am. Ah! There is no exact way to test a man’s worth; for human nature has confusion in it. For instance, I have seen before now the son of a noble father worth nothing, and good children from evil parents; famine in a rich man’s spirit, and a mighty soul in a poor man’s body. How then does one rightly distinguish and judge these things? By wealth? A sorry test to use. Or by those who have nothing? But poverty has a disease, it teaches a man to be wicked in his need. But shall I turn to warfare? Who, facing the enemy’s spear, could be a witness as to who is brave? It is best to leave these matters alone, at random. For this man, neither important in and by their habits. For such men rule well both states and homes; while those bodies that are empty of mind are only ornaments in the market-place. For the strong arm does not await the battle any better than the weak; this depends on natural courage. But, since Agamemnon’s son, both present and not present, for whose sake we have come, is worthy of it, let us accept a lodging in this house. but eager be a better host for me than a rich man! And so I am content with the reception into this man’s house, though I would have wanted your brother, in good fortune, to lead me to his fortunate home. Perhaps he may come; the oracles of Loxias are sure, but human prophecy I dismiss. Now more than before, Electra, I feel the warmth of joy at my heart; for perhaps good fortune, advancing with difficulty, might come to a good resting-place. O reckless man, why, knowing the poverty of your house, did you welcome these strangers, greater than you? What? If they are really as noble as they seem, won’t they be equally content among great and small? Since you, one of the small, have now made this error, go to my father’s dear old servant, who tends his flocks, an outcast from the city, by the river Tanaus which cuts a boundary between He will be glad, and will offer prayers to the gods, when he hears that the child, whom he once saved, is alive. I cannot get anything from my mother or from my father’s house; for we would bring bitter news, if she, the hard-hearted, were to learn that Orestes is still alive. I will take this message to the old man, if you wish; but go inside the house at once and make things ready there. Surely a woman, if she wants to, can find many additions to a meal.  Really there is still enough in the house to cram them with food for one day at least. It is in such cases, whenever I fail in my intentions, that I see how wealth has great power, to give to strangers, and to expend in curing the body when it falls sick; but money for our daily food comes to little; for every man when full, rich or poor, gets an equal amount. O famous ships, you that once with countless oars went to where the music-loving dolphin leapt and rolled at your dark-blue prows, bringing Achilles, the son of Thetis, light in the leap of his foot, with Agamemnon to the banks of Trojan Simois. The Nereids, leaving up to sea-born, swift-footed for the sons of Atreus. I heard, from someone who had arrived at the harbor of on the circle of your famous  shield, O son of Thetis, were wrought these signs, a terror to the Phrygians: on the surrounding base of the shield’s rim, Perseus the throat-cutter, over the sea with winged sandals, was holding the Gorgon’s body, with Hermes, Zeus’ messenger, the rustic son of In the center of the shield the sun’s bright circle was shining on winged horses, and the heavenly chorus of stars, Pleiades, Hyades, bringing defeat to the eyes of Hector; and upon his gold-forged helmet were sphinxes, bearing in their talons prey from singing. On his breast-plate a lioness, breathing flame, was eager in flight, with her claws, seeing the colt of Pirene. On the bloody hilt four-footed horses were prancing, while over their backs black dust rose up. But your adultery killed the lord of such mighty warriors, evil-minded daughter of Tyndareus! For this the gods of heaven will one day send you to death; truly the day will come when I shall see, under your red throat, blood gushing forth at the sword. Where, where is my young queen and mistress, Agamemnon’s child, whom I once brought up? How steep is the approach to her house, for a wrinkled old man to ascend with this foot! Still, for these friends, I must drag along my back bent double and sinking knees. Oh, daughter—for I see you now before the house—I have come, bringing you from my own sheep this newborn nursling of the flock, having drawn it away from its mother, and garlands, and cheeses I have taken from the press, and this old treasure of Dionysus, furnished with fragrance, small, but sweet to pour a cup of it into a weaker drink. Let some one carry these gifts into the house for the guests. I have moistened my eyes with tears, and wish to wipe them off on this shred of my robe. Why are your eyes wet, old man? Have my troubles stirred your memory, after an interval of time? Or are you groaning over the sad exile of Orestes, and over my father, whom you once held in your arms and brought up, in vain for you and for your friends? In vain; but still I could not endure this: for I came to his grave, an addition to my journey, and falling on it I wept for its desolation; then I opened the wine-skin which I am bringing to the guests, and poured a libation, and set myrtle-sprigs round the tomb. On the alter itself I saw a black-fleeced ram as an offering, and there was blood, not long poured out, and severed locks of yellow hair. And I wondered, child, who ever dared come to the the tomb; for it was no Go look to see if the color of the cut lock is the same as yours, putting it to your own hair; it is usual for those who have the same paternal blood to have a close bodily resemblance in most points. Old man, your words are unworthy of a wise man, if you think my own brave brother would come to this land secretly for fear of Aegisthus. Then, how will a lock of hair correspond, the one made to grow in the wrestling schools of a well-bred man, the other, a woman’s lock, by combing? No, it is impossible. But you could find in many people hair very similar, although they are not of the same blood, old man. Then stand in the footprint and see if the tread of the boot will measure with your own foot, child. How could there be an imprint of feet on a stony plot of ground? And if there is, the foot of brother and sister would not be the same in size, for the male conquers. There is not, even if your brother, coming to this land  .  .  . by which you might know your loom’s weaving, in which I once stole him away from death? Don’t you know that I was still young when Orestes was driven out of the land? And even if I had woven him a robe, how could he, a child then, have the same one now, unless his clothes grew together with his body? But either a stranger, taking pity on his grave. . . Where are the guests? I want to see them and question them about your brother. There they are, coming quickly out of the house. They are well-born, but that may ring false; for many of the well-born are base. However; I give the guests welcome. Welcome, old man! To which of your friends, Electra, does this ancient remnant of a man belong? This is the one who brought up my father, stranger. What are you saying? Is this the one who stole away your brother? This is the one who saved him, if indeed he is still alive. Oh! Why does he look at me, as if he were examining the clear mark impressed on a silver coin? Is he comparing me to someone? Perhaps he is glad to see in you a companion of Orestes. A beloved man, yes. But why is he circling all around me? I too am amazed, looking at this, stranger. O mistress, daughter Electra, pray to the gods. For what thing, present or absent? To have a beloved treasure, which the god is revealing. See: I call on the gods. Or whatever do you mean, old man? Look now at this man, my child, your dearest one. I have been looking for a long time, to see whether you have lost your mind. Lost my mind, because I see your brother? What do you mean, old man, by this word, unhoped for? That I see Orestes here, Agamemnon’s son. What mark do you see, by which I shall be persuaded? A scar along his brow, where he fell and drew blood one day in his father’s home when chasing a fawn with you. What are you saying? I see the sign of the fall. Then do you hesitate to embrace your dearest one? Not any longer, old man; for my heart is persuaded by your tokens. O you who have appeared at last, I hold you, beyond all hope. And you are held by me at last. I never expected it. Nor did I hope. Are you that one? Yes, your one ally. If I draw back the cast of the net I am aiming for—but I have confidence; or else we must no longer believe in gods, if wrong is to be victorious over right. You have come, you have come, oh, long-delayed day, you have lighted up, you have made visible a beacon to the city, who in long ago exile went forth from his father’s house, unhappily wandering. A god, now, a god brings our victory, my dear. Lift up your hands, lift up your words, send prayers to the gods for your brother with fortune, with fortune, to enter the city. Well; I have the loving pleasures of your greeting and later I will give them back in turn. You, old man, for you have come at the right time, tell me, what should I do to avenge myself on my father’s murderer Child, you have no friend in your misfortune. For this thing is a godsend indeed, to share in common, both good and bad. But you—for you have been destroyed from the foundations, in the eyes of your friends, and you have left them no hope—hear it from me and know: all that you have is in your own arm and fortune, to win your father’s home and your city. What must I do then to accomplish this? Kill Thyestes’ son and your mother. I have come for that victor’s crown; but how shall I grasp it? Not by going within the walls, even if you wanted to. Is he well furnished with garrisons and body-guards? You have understood; for, clearly, he is afraid of you, and does not sleep. Well; it is for you to plan the next step, old man. Hear me then; for something has just come to me. May you reveal something good, and may I understand it. I saw Aegisthus, when I was on my way here. I approve what you have said. Where was he? Near these fields, at his stables. What was he doing? I see some hope, out of difficulties. He was preparing a feast for the Nymphs, I thought. In return for the bringing up of children or for a coming birth? I only know this: he was preparing to sacrifice an ox. With how many men? Or alone with his slaves? No Surely there isn’t anyone who will know me if he sees me, old man? There are slaves, who have never even seen you. Would they be well disposed to me, if I should prevail? Yes, for that is the way of slaves, luckily for you. However might I approach him then? By going where he will see you as he sacrifices. He has fields by the road, it seems? Yes, and when he sees you there, he will invite you to the feast. I shall be a bitter companion in the feast, if the god wishes it. After that, you yourself invent something, as it falls out. Well said. But my mother, where is she? At Why didn’t my mother set out with her husband? From fear of the citizens’ reproach she stayed behind. I understand; she knows that the city suspects her. Something like that; for an unholy woman is an object of hatred. How then shall I kill her and him at once? I shall prepare my mother’s slaughter! And as for the other matter, fortune will ordain well. Let this man here help us with both. I will; but how will you find a way to kill your mother? Go to Clytemnestra, old man, and say this: report that I have given birth to a male child. That you have given birth some time ago, or quite recently? Ten days ago, in which a woman who has given birth stays pure. And how does this grant us the slaughter of your mother? She will come, when she hears of my childbirth pangs. How is that? Do you think she cares for you, child? Yes; and she will weep, surely, over my child’s low rank. Perhaps; bring your story back again to the turning-point. Well then, if she comes, it is clear that she will die. Yes, she will come right up to the door of your house. Won’t it then be a little thing for her to turn aside to Hades? May I die, once I have seen this! First of all, old man, guide my brother— To the place where Aegisthus is now sacrificing to the gods? Then, going to meet my mother, give her my message. So that the very words will seem to have been said by you. Your work begins at once; you have drawn the first lot in the slaughter. I would go, if some one would show me the way. Yes, I can escort you myself, not against my will. O Zeus, god of my fathers, be also the vanquisher of my enemies— And have pity on us; for we have suffered pitiably— Yes, indeed, have pity on your own descendants. And Hera, you who rule Give us victory, if we are asking for what is right. Yes, indeed, give them the right of vengeance for their father. You too, father, living below the earth through an unholy deed— And Lady Earth, to whom I give my hands— Defend, defend these, your dearest children. Now come and bring with you all the dead as allies. Those who destroyed the Trojans in war with you— And all who hate the unholy and polluted. Do you hear me, you who suffered dreadful things from my mother? Your father hears everything, I know; but it is time to be on our way. And I tell you therefore that Aegisthus is to die; if you fall dead in the struggle, I am also dead, do not count me as alive; for I will strike my heart with a two-edged sword. I will go indoors and make things ready there. So that if a good report comes from you, the whole house will cry aloud in triumph; but, if you die, it will be the opposite of that. These are my words to you. I know it all. Therefore you must be a man. a shout in signal of this contest. I will keep a sword ready, holding it in my hand, for I will not ever, if defeated, submit to my enemies the right to insult my body. The story remains in old legends that Pan, the keeper of wild beasts, breathing sweet-voiced music on his well-joined pipes, once brought from its tender mother on a lamb with beautiful golden fleece. A herald stood on the stone platform and cried aloud, The altars of beaten gold were set out; and through the town the altar fires of the Argives blazed; the flute, handmaid of the Muse’s song, sounded its note sweetly, and lovely songs of the golden lamb swelled forth, saying that Thyestes had the luck; for he persuaded Atreus’ own wife to secret love, and carried off to his house the portent; coming before the assembly he declared that he had in his house the horned sheep with fleece of gold. Then, it was then that Zeus changed the radiant paths of the stars, and the light of the sun, and the bright face of dawn; and the sun drove across the western back of the sky with hot flame from heaven’s fires, while the rain-clouds went northward and Ammon’s lands grew parched and faint, not knowing moisture, robbed of heaven’s fairest showers of rain. It is said, but I have small belief in it, that the sun turned round his glowing throne of gold, changing it to the misfortune of mankind, for the punishment of mortals. But tales that frighten men are profitable for service to the gods; of whom you had no thought, when you killed your husband, you who are the relative of famous brothers. Oh, oh! My friends, did you hear a noise—or did an empty notion come to me?—like the underground rumbling from Zeus? Look, the breeze rises, bringing with it a sign. Mistress, Electra, leave the house! My friends, what is it? How do we stand in the contest? I only know this; I hear a wailing that means bloodshed. I heard it also, far off, but still heard. Yes, the sound is coming a long way, but it is clear. The groan was of an I don’t know; for the whole tune of the shout is confused. You are calling out to me my death; why do I delay? Hold back, to learn your fortune clearly. No, no; we are vanquished; where are the messengers? They will come; it is no trivial matter to kill a king. O victorious maidens of Who are you? How trustworthy is your announcement? Don’t you know your brother’s servant when you look at me? O best of friends! I could not recognize your face out of fear; but now I know you well. What are you saying? Is my father’s hated murderer dead? He is dead; I am telling you twice what you certainly want to hear. O gods, and all-seeing justice, at last you have come. In what way and by what form of death did he kill Thyestes’ son? I would like to learn. After we had left this house, we stepped onto the broad highway and went to the place where the famous King of Some brought the bowl to catch the blood, others took up baskets, while others kindled fire and set cauldrons around the hearth, and the whole roof rang. Then your mother’s bed-fellow took barley for sprinkling, and cast it upon the altar with these words, that he might win his father’s house. Aegisthus took from a basket a long straight knife, and cutting off some of the calf’s hair laid it with his right hand on the sacred fire, and then cut the calf’s throat when the servants had lifted it upon their shoulders, and said this to your brother: Orestes seized in his hands the well-hammered Dorian knife and threw from his shoulders his graceful buckled robe; he chose Pylades as an assistant in the work and drove back the servants; and taking the calf by the hoof, he laid bare its white flesh, with arm outstretched, and flayed the hide quicker than a runner finishes the two laps of the horses’ race-course; and then he laid the flanks open. Aegisthus took the entrails in his hands and inspected them. Now the liver had no lobe, while the portal vein and near-by gall-bladder revealed threatening approaches to the one who was observing it. Aegisthus was angry, but my master asked, your brother rose on tiptoe and struck him on the spine; his back-bone broke apart; with his whole body he struggled up and down, and cried out, dying hard in his blood. As soon as the servants saw it, they rushed to arms, many to fight against two; yet Pylades and Orestes in their bravery stood to face them, brandishing their weapons. Then he said: And he comes bringing a head to show you, not that of the Gorgon, but of the one you hate, Aegisthus; his death today has paid in blood a bitter debt of blood. Set your step to the dance, my dear, like a fawn leaping high up to heaven with joy. Your brother is victorious and has accomplished the wearing of a crown . . . beside the streams of Alpheus. Come sing a glorious victory ode, to my dance. O light, O blaze of the sun, drawn by its team! O earth and night, all that I saw before; now I am free to open my eyes, for Aegisthus, my father’s murderer, has fallen. Come, let me bring out whatever adornment for hair that I have and my house contains, friends, and I shall wreath the head of my conquering brother. It is for you to bring adornment now for his head; our dance, dear to the Muses, will go on. Now, those who were once our dear kings will rule our land justly, having destroyed the unjust. So let the shout, harmonious with joy, go up. O glorious victor, Orestes, son of a father victorious in battle under Aegisthus, the murderer of your father and mine. And you, his companion, Pylades, taught by a most pious father, receive a garland from my hand; for you also bear an equal part of the contest, with Orestes. May you always seem to me fortunate! First believe that the gods, Electra, are the leaders of our fortune, and then praise me as the servant of them and of fate. I come, having killed Aegisthus not in word but in deed; to add this proof to your knowledge, I am bringing you his corpse, which, if you wish, you may expose as prey for wild animals or impale and press it down on a stake as spoil for birds, the children of the air; for now he is your slave, once called your master. I am ashamed, but equally I wish to speak. What is it? Speak, as you are free from fear. I am ashamed to insult the dead, for fear someone might hurl malice at me. There is no one who would blame you. Our citizens are hard to please, and love scandal. Speak, if you need to say anything, sister; for we engaged in hostilities with him on terms without truce. Well then! Which of your evil acts shall I tell of first, as a beginning? What sort of end shall I make? What part of my speech shall I assign to the middle place? And yet I never ceased, throughout the early mornings, repeating what I wished to say to your face, if ever I were free from my old terrors. And now I am; so I will pay you back with those reproaches I wanted to make when you were alive. You destroyed me, and orphaned me and this man here of a dear father, though you were wronged in no way by us; and you made a shameful marriage with my mother, and killed her husband, who led the armies of though you were wronging my father’s bed. Know that whoever ruins another’s wife, in secret love, and then is forced to take her himself, is pitiable, if he thinks that the chastity which did not govern her before will do so with him. You lived most miserably, although you thought it otherwise; you knew well that you had made an unholy marriage, and my mother knew that she had in you an impious husband. Both being wicked, she took up your fortune, you her evil. Among all the Argives you would hear this: but of their mother. For instance, when a man makes a remarkable marriage, one above his rank, there is no talk of the husband but only of the wife. This deceived you the most, in your ignorance: you professed to be some one, strong in your wealth, but that is nothing, except to associate with briefly. It is nature that is secure, not wealth; for, always standing by, it takes away troubles; but prosperity, when it lives wickedly and with fools, flies out of the house, flowering for a short time. As to your women, I am silent—for it is not good for a maiden to speak of this—but I will tell riddles that can be understood. You were insolent because you had a king’s house and were endowed with good looks. May I never have a husband with a girl’s face, but one with a man’s ways. For the children of the latter cling to a life of arms, while the fair ones are only an ornament in the dance. that he will get the better of Justice, until he comes to the end of the finish-line and makes the last turn in life. He did terrible things, and repaid them to you and Orestes; for Justice has great strength. Well then; you must carry the body of this man inside and hide it, slaves, so that when my mother comes, she may not see his corpse before her slaughter. Wait! Let us go into another matter. What? Those are not rescuers from Mycenae whom I see? No, but the mother who bore me. Then finely she walks to the middle of the net. —And here she comes, splendid in her chariot and dress. What are we going to do? Shall we kill our mother? Surely pity did not seize you, when you saw your mother? Ah! How can I kill her when she bore me and brought me up? As she killed your father and mine. O Phoebus, you prophesied a great folly— Where Apollo is a fool, who are the wise? You who declared I was to kill my mother, whom it is clearly wrong to kill. How can you be hurt by avenging your father? I shall stand trial as a matricide, though I was pure before. And by not defending your father, you will be impious. I, my mother—? To whom will I pay the penalty for her murder? And to whom, if you give up our father’s vengeance? Was it a fiend who spoke in the likeness of the god? Seated on the holy tripod? I do not think so. I cannot believe that this oracle was well prophesied. Do not become a coward and fall into unmanliness! Am I to devise the same crafty scheme for her? The same death that you gave to her husband, Aegisthus. I will go in; it is a dreadful task I am beginning and I will do dreadful things. If the gods approve, let it be; to me the contest is bitter and also sweet. Hail, Queen of the land of and sister of those two noble sons of Zeus who dwell in the fiery heavens among the stars, whose honored office it is to save mortals in the high waves. Welcome, I give you worship equal to the blessed gods for your wealth and great prosperity.  Now is the time to pay our court to your fortunes. Welcome, o queen. Come out of the wagon, Trojan maids, and take my hand, that I may step down from the chariot. The homes of the gods are adorned with Phrygian spoils, but I have obtained these women, choice objects from the land of And, mother—for I live as a slave in this miserable house, cast out from my father’s home—may I not take that blessed hand of yours? These slaves are here; take no trouble on my account. What? You sent me away from home, a captive; I was taken when my home was taken, like these, all of us orphaned of a father. Well, your father laid such plots against those whom least of all he should have, his own family. I will tell you; although when a woman gets an evil reputation, her tongue is bitter. In my opinion, not rightly; but it is correct for those who learn about the matter to hate, if it deserves hatred; if not, why hate at all? Now Tyndareus gave me to your father not so that I or any children I might bear should die. But that man went from the house, taking my child, with the persuasion of a marriage with Achilles, to or as a  benefit to his house, or to save his other children, he had killed one on behalf of many, I would have pardoned him. But, because Helen was lustful and the one who had her as a wife did not know how to punish the betrayer—for these reasons he destroyed my child. Well, although I was wronged, I would not have been angry at this, nor would I have killed my husband. But he came back to me with a girl, raving and possessed, and put her in his bed, and had two brides at once in the same house. A woman is a foolish thing, I don’t deny it; but, this granted, whenever a husband goes astray and rejects his own bed, the woman is likely to imitate her husband and find another love. And then in us the blame shines clearly, while the men, who caused this, are not badly spoken of. Now if Menelaus had been secretly snatched from his home, should I have killed Orestes to save Menelaus, my sister’s husband? How would your father have endured this? And so isn’t it right for him to die when he had killed what was mine, since I would have suffered at his hands? I killed him, I turned where indeed it was possible to go—to his enemies. For which one of your father’s friends would have joined me in his murder? Speak, if you want to say anything, and make your retort with frankness, in what way your father died unfairly. Justly spoken, but this justice is shameful. For a woman should yield to her husband in all things, if she has sense; anyone who does not agree does not come within the scope of what I say. Remember, mother, those last words of yours, giving me frankness towards you. I say it again, and I do not deny it, child. Then will you treat me badly, when you hear it? No, no, I will give some pleasure to your heart. I will speak, and this is the beginning of my preface: oh, mother, I wish that you had a better heart. For though your beauty, and Helen’s, is worthy to bring you praise, yet you two were born true sisters, both frivolous, not worthy of Castor. She was carried off, willingly ruined; and you have destroyed the bravest man in as soon as your husband had started from home, were adorning the golden locks of your hair at the mirror. A wife who decks herself out for beauty, when her husband is gone from home—strike her off the list as worthless. There is no need for her to show her pretty face out of doors, unless she is seeking some mischief. Of all the women in And yet it was in your power to be chaste, and rightly; you had a husband, no worse than Aegisthus, whom for the bad gives a standard of comparison to the good and provides a spectacle. But if, as you say, my father killed your daughter, what is the wrong I and and my brother have done you? How was it that after you had killed your husband, you did not assign to us our father’s home, but you brought the goods belonging to another to bed, buying your marriage with wages? And how is it that your husband is not exiled in the place of your son, nor has he died in my place, although he has killed me, alive, twice as much as my sister? If murder, giving judgment, requites murder, your son Orestes and I must kill you to avenge our father.  For if that was just, then so is this. Child, it was always your nature to love your father. This is what happens: some children are for their fathers, others in turn love their mothers more than a father. I will forgive you; for I do not rejoice so very much at what I have done, child. You, a woman who has just given birth—why is your body so unwashed and meanly clad? Alas for my schemes! I drove on in anger against my husband more than I should have. You sigh too late, when you have no remedy. My father is dead; but why do you not recall that exile, your own wandering son? l am afraid; I am looking to my interests, not his. For he is angry, they say, over the murder of his father. And why do you cause your husband to be cruel to me? Such are his ways. You have a stubborn nature also. Yes, for I am in distress. Yet I will cease from my anger. And then he will no longer be harsh to you. He is proud; for he lives in my home. You see? Again you are rekindling new quarrels. I am silent; I fear him—as I fear him. Stop this talk! But why did you summon me, child? You have heard, I suppose, that I have given birth; in thanks for this, please sacrifice—for I do not know how—on the tenth day, as is the custom for the child. For I have no experience, being childless before. This is work for another, the one who delivered you. I was all alone in my labor and at the baby’s birth. Is this household situated with no friends as neighbors? No one is willing to have the poor as friends. But I will go to make the tenth-day sacrifice to the gods for the child; and when I have done you this favor, I will go to the field where my husband is sacrificing to the Nymphs. Take this team away, my attendants, and bring it to the stalls; and when you think that I have finished this sacrifice to the gods, be ready; for I must also please my husband. Go into a poor house; but please take care that my smoke-grimed walls do not smear your robes with soot. For you will make the sacrifice to the gods that you ought to make. whom you slept with in life. This is the favor I will give you, and you will give me retribution for my father. Requital for evils; the breezes of the house shift and blow. At another time my leader, my own, fell murdered in the bath, and the roof and stone walls of the house cried aloud, while he said: Retribution for straying love has flowed back and brings to judgment the one who killed her wretched husband, when he came at last to his home and to the towering Cyclopean walls; with her own hand she killed him with the sharp-edged weapon, holding the axe in her hands. Unhappy husband! whatever the curse that possessed that wretched woman. Like a lioness of the hills that ranges through the meadowland woods, she accomplished these things. O children, by the gods, do not kill your mother. Do you hear her cries within the house? O God! Ah me! I also wail for you, overpowered by your children. Truly the god deals out justice, whenever it befalls. You have suffered cruelly, unhappy one, yet you did unholy things to your husband. But here they come from the house, defiled in the newly shed blood of their mother, a triumphal rout, evidence of the pitiable sacrifice. There is no house more pitiable than the race of Tantalus, nor has there ever been. O Earth, and Zeus who sees all mortal acts, look at these loathsome bloody deeds, these two bodies lying on the earth at the blow from my hand, atonement for my suffering .  .  . Too many tears, my brother, and I am the cause. Unhappy, that I came to fiery rage against this woman, who was my mother! Alas for your fate; you gave birth to unbearable pain, and you suffered it, miserably and beyond, from your children. Yet you have rightly paid for their father’s murder. Ah, Phoebus! you proclaimed in song unclear justice, but you have brought about clear woes, and granted me a bloody destiny far from the land of What host, what pious man will look at me, who killed my mother? Ah me! Where can I go, to what dance, to what marriage? What husband will receive me into the bridal bed? Again, again your thought changes with the breeze; for now you think piously, though you did not before, and you did dreadful things, my dear, to your unwilling brother. Did you see how the unhappy one threw off her robe and showed her bosom in the slaughter, alas, hurling to the ground the limbs that gave me birth? And her hair, I— I know it well; you passed through agony, hearing the mournful wail of the mother that bore you. She uttered this cry, putting her hand to my chin: The unhappy one! How did you endure to see the blood of your mother, breathing her last before your eyes? I threw my cloak over my eyes, and began the sacrifice by plunging the sword into my mother’s throat. And I urged you on and put my hand to the sword together with you. You have done the most dreadful of deeds. Take and hide the limbs of our mother beneath a robe, and close the wounds. There, I am putting this cloak over the one loved and not loved. An end of great troubles for the house.  For this path does not belong to men. Why ever do they come into the clear sight of mortals? Son of Agamemnon, listen; the twin sons of Zeus, your mother’s brothers, Castor and his brother Polydeuces, are calling you. Having just now calmed the swell of the sea, terrible for ships, we have come to and Phoebus, Phoebus—but I am silent, for he is my lord; although he is wise, he gave you oracles that were not. But it is necessary to accept these things. As to what remains, you must do what Fate and Zeus have accomplished for you. Give Electra to Pylades as his wife to take to his home; but you leave for she will prevent them, flickering with dreadful serpents, from touching you, as she stretches over your head her Gorgon-faced shield. There is a hill of Ares, where the gods first sat over their votes to decide on bloodshed, when savage Ares killed Halirrothius, son of the ocean’s ruler, in anger for the unholy violation of his daughter, so that the tribunal is most sacred and secure in the eyes of the gods. You also must run your risk here, for murder. An equal number of votes cast will save you from dying by the verdict; for Loxias will take the blame upon himself, since it was his oracle that advised your mother’s murder. And this law will be set for posterity, that the accused will always win his case if he has equal votes. Then the dread goddesses, stricken with grief at this, will sink into a cleft of the earth beside this hill, a holy, revered prophetic shrine for mortals. You must found an Arcadian city beside the streams of Alpheus near the sacred enclosure to Lycaean Apollo; and the city will be called after your name. I say this to you. As for this corpse of Aegisthus, the citizens of will bury her, with Helen helping him; for she has come from Proteus’ house, leaving go home from the Achaean land, and let him conduct the one called your brother-in-law to the land of For once you have completed your appointed lot of murder, you will be happy, freed from these troubles. Sons of Zeus, is it right for us to draw near to speak with you? It is right, for those not polluted by this murder. May I too share your conversation, sons of Tyndareus? You too; to Phoebus I will attribute this bloody deed. How was it that you, being gods and the brothers of this murdered woman, did not keep the death-goddesses away from her house? Necessity’s fate led to what must be, and unwise speech from the mouth of Phoebus. But what Apollo, what sort of oracles, ordained for me to be my mother’s murderer? The deeds were shared, the fates were shared; one ancestral curse has ground down both. Ah, my sister, seeing you after a long time, at once I am robbed of your affection, and I must abandon you, abandoned by you. She has a husband and a home; she does not suffer pitiably, except that she leaves the city of the Argives. And what other unhappiness is greater than to leave the boundary of one’s native land? But I shall leave my father’s house, and at a stranger’s tribunal undergo trial for my mother’s murder. Have courage; you will go to the holy town of Pallas; only hold out. Clasp me to your breast, my dearest brother; for the curse of our mother’s blood is separating us from our father’s home. Throw your arms in close embrace about me. Lament as if I were dead, over my grave. Alas! You have said things terrible even for gods to hear. For in me and in the Olympians there is pity for much-suffering mortals. I shall no longer see you! Nor will I draw near your sight! These are my last words to you. Farewell, my city! And a long farewell to you, my fellow-countrywomen! Are you going already, most faithful one? I am going, my young eye wet with tears. Go, Pylades, and be happy; marry Electra. Marriage will be for them to think of. But go towards the dark-skinned ones, with snakes for hands, holding a reward of dreadful pains. But we two must go in haste over the Sicilian sea to rescue the seagoing ships. As we go through the plains of the air, we do not come to the aid of those who are polluted; but we save and release from severe hardships those who love piety and justice in their ways of life. And so, let no one wish to act unjustly, or set sail with perjurers; as a god, I give this address to mortals. Farewell! Any mortal who is able to fare well, and is not worn down by any misfortune, achieves happiness.  \n",

commanded our forces at that consecrated land from which the gad-fly drove the daughter of Inachus; there, Orestes,\\n                     is the Lycean market place, named from the wolf-slaying god; there on the left\\n                     is Hera’s famous temple; and in this place to which we have come, know that you\\n                     see and here the house of Pelops’ heirs, so often stained with bloodshed. Long ago from here,\\n                     away from the murder of your father, I carried you for her whose blood is\\n                     yours, your sister, and saved you and reared you up to manhood to be the\\n                     avenger of your murdered father. Now, therefore, Orestes, and you, best of allies, Pylades, our plan of action must be\\n                     quickly laid; for look, already the sun’s bright ray is stirring the birds’\\n                     songs into clarity, and the kindly darkness of the stars is spent. Before, then, anyone comes out from the house, we must make our plans, since we are at the point where it is no longer opportune to hesitate, but it is the moment for action. True friend and follower, how well you prove your loyalty to our house! Just as a thoroughbred mount, even if advanced in years, does not lose courage in danger, but pricks up his ears, so you speed us forward and follow in the first ranks.  I will tell you, then, what I have determined. Listen closely to my words and correct me, if I miss the mark in any way. Phoebus gave me the commandment which you will now hear: that alone, and by stealth,\\n                     without the aid of arms or large numbers, I should carry off my right hand’s\\n                     just slaughters. Accordingly, since I received this divine declaration, you\\n                     must go into that house there when opportunity gives you entrance, and learn all that is happening, so that you may report to us out of sure knowledge.  Your age and the lapse of time will prevent them from recognizing you;  they will never suspect who you are with that silvered hair.  Let your story be that you are a Phocian stranger sent by Phanoteus, since he is the greatest of their allies.  Tell them, and affirm it with your oath, that Orestes has perished by a fatal chance, hurled at the Pythian games from his speeding chariot. Let that be the substance of your message. Meanwhile, we will\\n                     first crown my father’s tomb as the god ordered with libations and the\\n                     luxuriant tribute of a severed lock; then we will return here, bearing in our\\n                     hands an urn of hammered bronze —now hidden, as you no doubt know, in the brushwood—so that we may gladden them with the false tidings that this body of mine exists no more, but has been consumed with fire and reduced to ashes.  How does it hurt me, when by feigned death I find true life and win renown?  No word is ill-omened, I trust, if it yields gain.  For often before now I have seen clever men die in false report;  then, when they return home, they are held in greater honor. And so for myself I trust that as a result of this rumor I, too, shall live, shining down like a star upon my enemies. since I come by divine mandate to cleanse you as justice demands.  Do not dismiss me from this land in dishonor, but grant that I may rule over my possessions and restore my house! The two of us will depart;  for so opportunity bids, chief ruler of every enterprise for men. ah, me, ah, joyless me! Listen, my son;  from the doors of the house, I think, came the sound of some serving girl moaning inside. Can it be my joyless Electra?  Shall we remain here and listen to her cries? No, no;  before all else, let us strive to obey the commands of Loxias and from them make a fair beginning by pouring libations to your father.  For such actions bring victory within our grasp and give us mastery in all our doings. O you pure sunlight, and you air, light’s equal partner over earth, how often have you\\n                     heard the chords of my laments and the thudding blows against this bloodied breast at the time of gloomy night’s leaving\\n                     off! My accursed bed in that house of suffering there knows well already how I\\n                     observe my night-long rites—how often I bewail my miserable father, whom bloody Ares did not welcome with deadly gifts in a foreign land, but my mother and her bedfellow Aegisthus split his head with murderous axe, just as woodmen chop an oak. And for this crime no pitying cry bursts from any lips but mine, when you, Father, have died a death so cruel and so deserving of pity! Ah, Electra, child of a most wretched mother, why are you always wasting away in this unsated mourning for Agamemnon, who long ago was godlessly ensnared in your false mother’s wiles and betrayed by her corrupt hand? May the one who\\n                        did that perish, if I may speak such a curse without breaking the gods’\\n                        laws. Ah, noble-hearted girls, you have come to relieve me in my troubles.  I know and feel it: it does not escape me.  Still I cannot leave this task undone, nor abandon this mourning for my poor father.  Ah, friends whose love responds to mine in every mood, allow me to rave as I am, oh, please, I beg you! But never by weeping nor by prayer will you resurrect your father from the pool of Hades which receives all men. No, by grieving without end and beyond due limits you will find cureless misery and your own ruin;  in these actions there is no deliverance from evils.  Tell us, why do you pursue such suffering? Foolish is the child who forgets a parent’s piteous death. No, closer to my heart is the\\n                        mourner who eternally wails, Ah, all-suffering Niobe, you I count divine, since you weep forever in your rocky tomb! Not to you alone of mortals, my daughter, has sorrow come, though you face it with less restraint than those girls inside, Chrysothemis and Iphianassa, whose parents and blood you share.  They still live, as he, too, lives, sorrowing in his secluded youth, yet happy in that this famous realm of the Mycenaeans shall one day receive him as a\\n                        noble lord, if with the blessing of Zeus’s escort he, Orestes, returns to\\n                        this land. Yes, I await him with unwearied longing, as I walk my sad path from day to day childless and unwed, bathed in tears, bearing that endless doom of evils.  But he forgets all that he has suffered and learned. What message comes to me that is not proven false?  He constantly desires to be with us, but though he desires it, he does not choose to appear. Courage, my daughter, courage;  Zeus in the sky is still mighty, and he sees and rules all.  Leave your oversharp anger to him;  be neither excessively hostile to those you hate, nor forgetful of them, since Time is a god who brings ease. Neither the son of Agamemnon, who dwells by But the best part of life has passed away leaving me in hopelessness, and I have no strength left.  I waste away without children and have no loving husband to champion me, but like some despised foreign slave, I serve in the halls of my father, wrapped in shabby garments and standing to eat scanty meals. Mournful was the voice heard at his return, and mournful the voice amidst your father’s\\n                        reclining banquet when the straight, swift blow of the bronze-jawed axe was sped against him.  Deceit was the plotter, Lust the slayer, two dread parents of a dreadful phantom, whether it was god or mortal that did this deed. O that hated day, hated beyond all that have come to me;  O that night, the terrible grief of that unutterable feast, the shameless death-strokes my father saw from their twin hands, hands which took my life captive by treachery, which cast me to ruin!  May the great god of create for them sufferings in penalty, and may they never have enjoyment of their splendor since they have committed such crimes! Be advised to say no more;  do you not see by what actions under the present circumstances you plunge so shamefully into self-made miseries?  You have far excelled in achieving misfortune, ever breeding wars in your hardhearted soul.  But such strife should not be pushed into a conflict with the powerful. I have been forced to it, forced by a terrible compulsion.  I know my own passion; it does not escape me;  but, under such terrible compulsion, I will not restrain these disastrous cries of frenzy, so long as life is in me.  Who indeed, my noble friends, who that keeps what is appropriate in mind, would think any word of comfort right for my ears?  Let me be, let me be, my comforters! For these ills will be reckoned with those which have no cure;  I will never know a respite from my pains, or the sum of this wailing. It is nevertheless with goodwill, like a true-hearted mother, that I dissuade you from begetting misery upon miseries. But what limit has nature begot for my affliction? Tell me, how can it be right to\\n                        neglect the dead? Has such a seed been sown in any mortal? May I never have\\n                        such men’s esteem; never, when I am close to prosperity, may I dwell in ease, hindering the wings of shrill lamentation so as to deprive my begetter of his honors! while his slayers do not pay back to him blood for blood in penalty, then shame and reverence will vanish from all humanity. I came, my child, mindful of your interests no less than my own.  But if what I say is wrong, let your way prevail;  for united we will follow you. I am ashamed, my friends, if you judge me too intolerant with my many laments; but, since rough compulsion forces me to act this\\n                     way, forgive me. How indeed could any woman of noble nature not act, when she\\n                     sees her father’s sufferings as I see them day and night continually, and flourishing rather than fading? First, everything to do with the mother who bore me\\n                     has become most hateful towards me; next, in my own home I live with my\\n                     father’s murderers; they rule over me and from them equally I either have or do without. pouring libations at the hearth where he killed him; and when I see the chief outrage of\\n                     them all, the murderer in my father’s bed at my wretched mother’s side, if I\\n                     must call her mother, even though she shares her bed with that man. So hardened is she that she joins with this polluter, fearing no Erinys.  No, as if laughing at her deeds, having found the day on which in the past she treacherously killed my father, she celebrates it with dance and song, and in monthly rites she sacrifices sheep to the gods who worked her deliverance. Tell me, is Aegisthus nearby as you speak these words to us, or has he left the house? He is gone, to be sure.  Do not think that I would have come to the doors, if he were nearby. He happens now to be in the country. Might I converse with you more boldly, if this is so? He is not here, so question me.  What is it you want? I ask you, then, what report can you give of your brother?  Will he come soon, or is he delaying?  I wish to know. He says he will come, but although he promises he never does what he says. True, a man will hesitate on the verge of a great undertaking. And yet I saved him with no hesitation. Take heart: he is noble enough to stand by his friends. I believe it;  otherwise I would not have remained alive so long. Say no more now, since I see your sister coming from the house, Chrysothemis, offspring of the same father and mother.  In her hands are sepulchral offerings, such as are customary for those in the world below. What is this speech of yours, sister, which you have come forth yet again to speak at the public doors? Will you not learn with any lapse of time to end your vain indulgence in futile anger?  Yet this much I know—that I myself am saddened by our present circumstances;  indeed so much so that, could I find the strength, I would bare my feelings towards them. But now, in these evil times I think it best to navigate with shortened sail so that I may not seem to be on the attack, when I am unable to cause harm.  I wish that your own conduct were the same!  Nevertheless, right is on the side which you favor, not on that which I advise.  But if I am to live the life of the freeborn, those in power must be obeyed in all things. It is strange, indeed, that you, the daughter of our father from whom you grew, should forget him and instead show concern for your mother!  All your admonitions to me have been taught by her;  you speak no word of your own. So now take your choice:  be imprudent, or be prudent, but forgetful of your friends.  You have just said that if could you find the strength, you would show your hatred of them;  yet, when I am doing my utmost to avenge our father, you do not work with me, but seek to deflect your sister from her deed. And I hurt them, and thereby affix an honorable tribute to the dead, in case those in that world can enjoy it and feel gratitude.  But you, who tell me of your hatred, hate in word alone, while by your behavior you unite with the murderers of our father.  I, however, would never yield to them, not even if one of them were to bring to me the gifts in which you now glory.  Let yours be the richly-spread table and superabundant lifestyle.  As for me, let my sustenance be only that I do not wound my own conscience—I do not covet such privilege as yours and neither would you, if you had self-control. But now, when you could be called the child\\n                     of the noblest father among men, be called instead your mother’s daughter, for\\n                     in this way your corruptness will be evident to the greatest number as you\\n                     betray your dead father and your true friends. Away with anger, for the gods’ sake! There is advantage for both of you in what is urged, if you, Electra, would learn to implement her advice, and she, again, yours. For my part, friends, I am not at all unaccustomed to her insults, nor would I have mentioned this, if I had not heard that the greatest disaster is now rushing down on her, one which will restrain her from her long mourning. Come then, name this terror!  If you can tell me of anything worse than my present condition, I would resist no more. I will tell you all that I know.  If you will not cease from your mourning, they intend to send you where you will never look upon the sun’s brilliance, but passing your life in\\n                     a covered chamber beyond this land’s borders you will make hymns of your\\n                     calamity. Think on this, and do not blame me later, when you suffer. Now is the\\n                     time to think wisely. Have they in fact decided to do this to me? They certainly have, as soon as Aegisthus comes home. Then for this, may he arrive quickly! Troubled girl, what curse are you laying on yourself? That he may come, if he plans to do any of what you said. So that you may suffer?  In what way?  Where are your wits? So that I may fly as far as possible from you all. Have you no care for the life you lead now? oh, yes, my life is so wondrously fine. It would be, if only you learned good sense. Do not teach me to betray my friends. I do not, but to bend before the strong. Keep your flattery to yourself;  it is not in my character. Regardless, it brings no honor to fall through senselessness. I will fall, if need be, while honoring  my father. But our father, I know, pardons me for this. It is for cowards to commend such sentiments. So you will not be persuaded to agree with me? No, indeed;  may I not yet be so devoid of intelligence. Then I will move on to where I was sent. And where is it that you go?  For whom do you take these offerings to be burned? Mother sends me with funeral libations for our father. What are you saying?  For her deadliest enemy? What friend persuaded her?  Whose idea was it? The cause, I think, was fear induced by some vision in the night. My father’s Gods! Stand with me now at last! Do you find something heartening in this terror? If you would tell me the vision, then I could answer. I know no more than a small part of the story. Tell me that, anyway;  a small tale has often before now tripped men up, or set them upright. It is said that she saw the father of you and of me restored to the sunlight and to her company once more.  Then he took the scepter— once his own, but now carried by Aegisthus—and planted it at the hearth.  From it branched upward a flourishing limb, by which the whole land of the Mycenaeans was overshadowed.  Such was the tale that I heard told by one who was present when she revealed her dream to the Sun-god.  More than this I do not know, except that she sent me by reason of this fear of hers.  Now, I beg you by our ancestral gods, obey me, and do not fall in your senselessness! If you reject me now, it is in misery that you will next seek me out. Dear sister, let none of these offerings in your hands touch the tomb.  For neither divine law nor piety allows you to dedicate funeral gifts or bring libations to our father from his hateful wife. No! To the winds with them! Or cover them in a deep, dusty hole, where not one of them\\n                     will ever come near our father’s resting place. Rather let these treasures be\\n                     preserved for her below when she dies. Were she not by nature the most\\n                     audacious of all women, she would never at all have tried to pour these ill-willed offerings to the man she killed.  Consider whether you believe that the dead in his tomb will welcome this tribute with affection towards her, by whose hand he died dishonored and was mutilated like an enemy? She, who, as if to wash herself clean, wiped off the bloodstains on his\\n                     head? Surely you do not believe that your bringing these things will absolve\\n                     her of the murder? and from wretched me, too, give these gifts, poor as they are, though all I have.  Take this hair, not glossy with unguents, and this girdle, decked with no rich ornament.  Then fall down and pray that he himself may come in kindness to us from the world below, a helper against our enemies; and that young Orestes may live to set his foot upon our enemies in superior might, so\\n                     that hereafter we may crown our father’s tomb with wealthier hands than those\\n                     with which we honor him now. in sending her these appalling dreams. Still, sister, do yourself this service and help\\n                     me, and him, too, that most beloved of all men, who rests in Hades’ domain, our\\n                     shared father. The girl’s advice is pious; you, dear friend, will do what she says, if you are wise. I will.  In regard to a just deed, it is unreasonable for two people to argue, but reasonable to jump to action.  But, by the gods, my friends, when I attempt this task, let me have your silence, since if my mother hears of it, I believe that this attempt which I will dare shall in\\n                     the end cause me bitterness. If I am not a deranged prophet and one who lacks wise judgments, Justice, the sender of the omen, will come, winning the just victory of her hands’ might.\\n                        She will come in pursuit before long, my child. Courage is mine, since I heard just now of this sweet-blowing dream.  Never does the lord of the Hellenes, your producer forget, nor does the axe of long ago forget, striking with bronze on its jaws, which in most shameless disgrace annihilated him. She, too, will come, she of many hands and many feet who lurks in her terrible ambush, the bronze-shod Erinys.  For an unwed, unbetrothed passion for a marriage polluted by murder seized the pair, though divine law forbade it to them. Therefore I am confident that the portent—a wonder which I will never blame—will draw near to the criminals and conspirators.  To be sure, mortal prophecy from fearful dreams or divine signs exists no more, if this vision of the night does not find due fulfillment. O chariot-race of Pelops long ago, source of many a sorrow, what disaster you have brought upon this land!  For ever since Myrtilus sank to rest beneath the waves, hurled to utter destruction from his golden chariot in disgraceful outrage, from that time to this, outrage and its many sorrows were never yet gone from this house. You run loose again, it seems, since Aegisthus is not here, who used always to keep you at least from coming out to the gates and shaming your family.  But now, since he is absent, you pay me no mind.  And yet you have said of me often and to many listeners that I am a rash and unjust tyrant, who violently abuse you and yours.  But it is not I who do violence;  I only return the insults that I so often hear from you. Your father—this and nothing else is your constant pretext—was slain by me.  Yes, by me.  I know it well.   I make no denial.  Justice took hold of him, not I alone—Justice, whom you ought to have supported, if you had been in your right mind. For this father of yours whom you constantly bewail alone of all the Greeks had the heart to sacrifice your own blood, your sister, to the gods—he, who, when sowing his seed, felt none of the pains I did when I gave birth. did he sacrifice her?  To please the Argives, you will say?  No, they had no right to kill my daughter.  Or, if indeed it was for the sake of his brother Menelaus that he killed my child, was he not to pay me the penalty for that?  Did Menelaus not have two children, who should in fairness have died instead of my daughter, since the father and mother from whom they were sprung had caused that voyage?  Did Hades have some greater desire to feast on my offspring than on hers?  Or had all love of the children of my womb been abandoned by their accursed father, while love for the children of Menelaus filled him? Were these not the marks of a thoughtless and malicious parent?  I think so, even if I differ from your judgment.  So, too, would the dead girl speak, if she could find a voice.  For myself, then, I view the past without dismay;  but if you think my attitude criminal, see that your own judgment is just before you blame your neighbor. This time, at least, you cannot say that I first gave you cause for upset and thereby provoked such words from you.  But, if you will permit me, I would gladly declare the truth, on behalf of my dead father and my sister alike. Certainly I permit you;  and if you always addressed me in such a tone, you would not be difficult to listen to. Then I will speak.  You admit that you killed my father.  What statement could be more shameful still than that, whether you did it justly or not?  But I will demonstrate to you that you did not justly kill him.  No, the persuasion of that wicked man with whom you now sleep dragged you to it. or I will tell you, since we may not learn from her.  My father, as I have heard, was once hunting in the grove of the goddess, when his footfall flushed a dappled and antlered stag;  he shot it, and chanced to make a certain boast concerning its slaughter. Angered by this, Leto’s daughter detained the Greeks so that in requital for the beast’s\\n                     life my father should sacrifice his own daughter. So it was that she was\\n                     sacrificed, since the fleet had no other release, neither homeward nor to For that reason, under fierce constraint and with much resistance, at last he sacrificed her—but it was not for the sake of Menelaus. See that by laying down such a law for men, you do not lay down trouble and remorse for yourself.  For, if we are to take blood for blood, you surely would be the first to die, if you were to meet with justice. For tell me, if you please, what crime it is that you requite by doing the most shameless deeds of all:  sharing your bed with that blood-guilty one, with whom you first destroyed my father and now bear his children while you have cast out the earlier born, the pious offspring of a pious marriage? How\\n                     can I commend these deeds? Or will you claim that this, too, is recompense for\\n                     your daughter? No, it is a shameful plea, if you so plead, for there is nothing\\n                     noble in marrying an enemy for a daughter’s sake. But no, I can hardly even admonish you, when your every cry is that I slander my mother.  I think, rather, that you are no less a mistress to me than a mother;  so lowly is the life that I live, ever beset with miseries come from you and your consort.  And your other child, the exile who scarcely escaped your hand, poor Orestes, wastes away his unhappy life.  You have often accused me of rearing him to punish your crime, and I would have done so, if I could, you may be sure.  As far as he is concerned, you can denounce me to all as disloyal, if you like, or loud-mouthed, or impudent.  For if my nature is familiar with such wrongdoings, I hardly bring disgrace upon your nature. I see her breathing fury;  but whether justice is with her, her concern for this I see no longer. And what manner of concern should I use against her, who has abused her mother like this at her mature age?  Do you not think that she would go forward to any deed without shame? Now be assured that I do feel shame for it, though I seem not to you.  I know that my behavior is unsuited to my age and inappropriate.  But then the enmity I get from you and your behavior compel me with harsh necessity to do this;  for reprehensible deeds are learned from reprehensible examples. You shameless creature!  Truly I and my speech and my deeds give you too much to talk about. The words are yours, not mine; for yours are the deeds, and they find their own expression. Now by our mistress Artemis, you shall not escape the consequences of this audacity once Aegisthus returns. You see?  You are driven to rage and, even though you grant me free speech, you have no patience to listen. Will you not allow me to sacrifice without ominous shouting, when I have permitted you to say anything and everything you wished? I allow it;  I exhort you to it:  sacrifice!  But do not blame my voice, for I would not say another word. Raise then, my attendant, the offerings of many fruits, so that I may uplift my prayers for release from my present fears to this image of our King.  Please, O Phoebus our defender, may you now listen to my prayer, though it is muffled;  for I do not make my plea among friends, nor does it suit me to unfold it all to the light while she stands near me, lest by her malice and a cry of her clamorous tongue she sow reckless rumors through the whole city.  Nevertheless, hear me thus, since in this way I will speak.  That vision which I saw last night in ambiguous dreams—if its appearance was to my good, grant, Lycean king, that it be fulfilled;  but if to my harm, then hurl it back upon those who would harm me.  And if any are plotting to eject me by treachery from my present prosperity, do not permit them. Rather grant that living forever unharmed as I am I may govern the house of the sons of Atreus and their throne, sharing prosperous days with the friends who share them now, and with those of my children who feel no enmity or bitterness towards me. O Lycean Apollo, hear these prayers with favor, and grant them to us all just as we ask!\\n                     As for all my other prayers, though I am silent, I judge that you, a god, must\\n                     know them, since it is appropriate that Zeus’s children see all. Foreign ladies, how might I know for certain if this be the palace of the king Aegisthus? This is the palace, stranger;  you yourself have guessed correctly. And am I on target when I surmise that this lady is his wife?  She is indeed regal to look upon. Exactly right;  this is she before you. Greetings, royal lady!  I bring happy news to you and to Aegisthus from a friend. I welcome your greeting;  but I would like first to know who may have sent you. Phanoteus the Phocian provided me the weighty task. And what is it, sir?  Tell me.  Coming from a friend you will bring, I know, a kindly message. Orestes is dead, to put it briefly. Oh, miserable me!  My ruin comes today! What, friend?  What did you say?  Do not listen to her! I said, and say again, This is my wretched end!  I am no more! You, go about your business!  But you, sir, tell me exactly in what manner he was destroyed. I was sent for that purpose, and will tell you all. Having gone to the shrine which is he entered the lists, a brilliant form, a wonder in the eyes of all there.  When he had finished the race at the point where it began, he went out with the glorious honor of victory.  To say the most with the least words, I do not know the man whose deeds and triumphs have matched his. But this one thing you must know:  in all the contests that the judges announced, he carried away the prize, and men deemed him happy as often as the herald proclaimed him an Agamemnon, who once marshalled he entered it along with many charioteers.  One was an Achaean, one from with chestnut colts;  a Magnesian was the seventh;  the eighth, with white horses, was of Aenian stock;  the ninth hailed from placed them by lot and ranged the cars.  Then at the sound of the bronze trumpet, they started.  All shouted to their horses, and shook the reins in their hands;  the whole course was filled with the clatter of rattling chariots;  and the dust flew upward. All of them in a confused throng kept plying their goads unsparingly, so that one of them might pass the wheel-hubs and the snorting steeds of his rivals;  for both at their backs and at their rolling wheels the breath of the horses foamed and smattered. Orestes, driving close to the near edge of the turning-post, almost grazed it with his\\n                     wheel each time and, giving rein to the trace-horse on the right, he checked\\n                     the horse on the inner side. To this point, all the chariots still stood\\n                     upright. But then the Aenian’s hard-mouthed colts carried him out of control as they passed out of the turn from the sixth into the seventh lap and dashed their foreheads against the rig of the Barcaean.  Next, as a result of this one mishap, the cars kept smashing and colliding with each other, and the whole race-ground of Oh, sorrow!  It seems now that all the stock of our ancient masters has been leveled clean down to the roots. O Zeus, how shall I name this news—fortunate?  Or terrible, but beneficial?  It is a bitter thing, when by my own misery I preserve my life. Why are you so despondent, lady, at my news? There is a terrible power in motherhood;  a mother may be wronged, but she can feel no hate for those whom she bore. Then it seems that we have come in vain. No, not in vain;  how can you say He sprang from my own life, yet deserting my breast and my nurture he became a fugitive, completely alien from me.  And me, once he left this land, he saw no more;  but, charging me with the murder of his father, he made terrible threats, so that neither by night nor by day could sweet sleep cover me, but the imminent moment made me live always as if I were about to die.  Now, however, since today I am rid of terror of him and of this girl—that greater plague who shared my home while consuming undiluted my life-blood—now, I think, for all her threats, I shall pass my days in peace. Ah, what misery!  Now, indeed, Orestes, I must mourn your misfortune, since even dead as you are you are abused by this woman, your mother!  Is it not just fine? You certainly are not, but he is fine as he is. Listen to her, Nemesis of the recently departed! She has heard who should be heard, and has ordained well. Abuse us!  Fortune is with you today. You and Orestes will not stop me, then, will you? It is we who are stopped;  we cannot stop you. Your coming, sir, deserves large recompense, if you have stopped her clamorous tongue. Then I would take my leave, if all is well. Not so;  your welcome would then be unworthy of me, and of my ally who sent you.  No, come in.  Leave her out here to shout out loud her misfortunes and those of her friends. What do you think?  Does it seem to you that she, poor woman, wept and wailed terribly, like a grieving, anguished woman, over her son thus destroyed?  No, she left us with a laugh!  Ah, miserable me!  Dearest Orestes, how your death has destroyed me!  For your passing has torn from my heart the only hopes which still were mine:  that you would live to return some day as the avenger of our father, and also of me in my misery.  But now, where shall I turn?  I am alone, cheated of you, as of my father.  Hereafter I must be a slave again among those I most hate, my father’s murderers. Am I not in a fine way? But at least in\\n                     the time remaining me I will never enter the house to dwell with them. No,\\n                     lying down at these gates, without a friend, I shall wither away my days. Therefore, if anyone in the house be angry, let him kill me.  It is a favor, if I die, but a pain, if I live.  I desire life no more. Where are the thunderbolts of Zeus, or where the shining Sun, if they look upon these things and quietly cover them over? Ah, me, ah, me! My child, why do you weep? Oh! Give no cry of bad omen! You will break my heart! How do you mean? If you suggest that I keep hope for those who have surely passed to Hades, you will trample even harder upon me as I waste away. No, for I know that the prince Amphiaraus was ensnared by a woman’s chain of gold and\\n                        swallowed up. And now beneath the earth— ah, me, ah, me! —He reigns supreme with the wits of the living. ah, me! ah, me, indeed!  For the murderess— Was slain. Yes. I know it; I know it.  For a champion arose to avenge the grieving dead.  But for me no champion remains:  he who yet remained has been snatched clean away. Unhappy are you, unhappy your destiny! How well I know that, all too well, with my life swept through all the months by abundant terrors and horrors! We have witnessed the events for which you mourn. Cease, then, to divert me from it, since no longer— What do you say? —Since I no longer have hope in my brother, the seed of our shared noble line, to aid me. Nature ordains death as the destiny of all mortals. What, a death like the one which that ill-fated one died beneath a race of swift hooves, entangled in the cutting, dragging reins? The mutilation is beyond thought! Yes, so it is, when in foreign soil, without being tended by my hands— Ah, no! —he has been buried not receiving from me either burial or lamentation. I am pursued by joy, dear sister, and I disregard seemliness in order to come with speed.  I bring joyful news to relieve your former troubles and grief. And from where could you find help for my sufferings, when no cure for them can be imagined? Orestes is with us—know this from my lips—plainly visible, just as you see me now. What, are you insane, poor girl? Do you laugh at my sorrows and your own? No, by our father’s hearth, I do not speak in mockery. I tell you that he\\n                     truly is with us. Ah, miserable girl!  And from whom on earth have you heard this tale, which you believe so lightly? I have it on my own knowledge, no one else’s; I have seen clear proofs. What have you seen, poor girl, to warrant your belief?  What did you see, that you are warmed by this unquenchable fire? Now, for the gods’ love, listen, so that you may know the rest from me before deciding whether I am sane or foolish. Speak on, then, if you find pleasure in speaking. Well, I will tell you all that I have seen. When I came to Father’s\\n                     ancestral tomb, I saw that streams of milk had recently flowed from the top of\\n                     the mound and that his sepulchre was encircled with garlands of all flowers that grow.  I was astonished at the sight, and peered about lest somehow someone should approach close to me.  But when I perceived that all the place was in stillness, I crept nearer to the tomb, and on the mound’s edge I saw a lock of hair, freshly\\n                        severed. Then I lift it in my hands and make no sound of bad omen, but the tears of joy straightaway fill my eyes.  Even now I know well, just as I knew then, that this fair tribute has come from no one but him.  Whom else does that tomb concern, save me and you? And I did not make those offerings, I know, nor did you. How could you, when you cannot\\n                     leave this house even to worship the gods without later regretting it? Nor,\\n                     again, does our mother’s heart incline to do such deeds, nor could she have\\n                     done so without our knowledge. No, these offerings are from Orestes!  Come, dear sister, have courage!  Not always does the same fortune, it is true, attend the same individuals.  Ours was once to be despised, but today, perhaps, will seal the promise of much good. Oh, what foolishness!  How I have been pitying you! What, is my news unpleasing to you? You do not know where on earth or into what dreams you wander. How could I not know what I have plainly seen? He is dead, poor girl, and your salvation by him is gone.  Do not look to him. Ah, miserable me!  From whom have you heard this? From the man who was present when he perished. And where is he?  Amazement steals over my mind. He is inside, a welcome guest, not unpleasing to our mother. Ah, misery! Who, then, can have made those ample offerings to my father’s tomb? Most likely, I think, someone placed those gifts in memory of the dead Orestes. Oh, my misfortune!  And I was hurrying here with such joyous nows, ignorant after all of our downfall.  But now that I have arrived, I find fresh sorrows added to the old! So it stands with you.  Yet if you will be persuaded by me, you will lighten the load of our present trouble. How can I ever raise the dead back to life? That is not what I meant;  I was not born so foolish. What do you urge, then, of those things that I am capable of doing? That you be brave in executing what I recommend. If any good can be done, I will not refuse. Remember, nothing succeeds without toil. I know it, and I will share your burden with all my power. Hear, then, in what way I have decided to take action.  As for the support of friends, you yourself doubtless know that we have none.  Hades has taken our friends away, and we two are left alone.  I, so long as I heard that my brother still lived and prospered, had hopes that he would yet come to avenge the murder of our father.  But now that he is no more, I look next to you and ask that you not flinch from aiding me, your sister, to slay our father’s murderer,\\n                     Aegisthus. There—I can have no secrets from you anymore. that you are robbed of possession of your father’s estate; now you may mourn that you\\n                     have advanced this far in years without wedded love or bridal song. And do not\\n                     cling to hopes that you will ever meet with such joys. The man, Aegisthus, is\\n                     not so unthinking as ever to permit that offspring should shoot up from you or from me either to be a certain bane for himself.  But if you will follow my plans, first you will win praise for piety from our dead father below, and from our brother, too; next, you shall be called hereafter free, just as you were born, and shall find a worthy marriage.  For noble natures draw the gaze of all. What citizen or stranger when he sees us will not greet us with praises such as these: so that in life and in death our glory shall not fail. In a crisis such as this, forethought is an ally both to those who speak and those who listen. Yes, I agree.  And before she spoke, my friends, if she were blessed with a sound mind, she would have remembered caution, even as she does not now. Where can you have turned your eyes, that you arm yourself with such rashness and call me\\n                     to serve beneath you? Do you not see? Your nature is a woman’s, not a man’s,\\n                     and the strength of your hand is less than that of your adversaries. And their\\n                     fortune prospers day by day, while ours ebbs and comes to nothing.  Who, then, plotting to subdue such a man, would escape destruction unharmed?  See to it that, badly as we fare now, we do not acquire greater evil, if any one hears this talk of yours. It brings us no relief or benefit, if after winning fair fame we die an ignominious death.  For death is not the most odious thing;  it is rather craving death, but lacking the means to die.  No, I plead with you, before we are utterly, totally destroyed and before we leave our house desolate, restrain your rage!  I will take care that your words remain secret and harmless for you.  You in turn must get hold of good sense at long last and yield to the powerful since you have no strength. Listen to her.  There is no better gain for mortals to win than foresight and a prudent mind. You have said nothing unexpected.  Well I knew that you would reject what I proposed.  But the deed must be done with my own hand, by me and me alone. I certainly will not leave it unaccomplished. Ah! If only you had had such resolve on the day of our father’s death! Then\\n                     you would have accomplished everything! My nature was the same then, but my mind was less ripe. Strive to keep your mind that way through all your life. You make these admonitions like one who will not assist me. I will not, for he who sets hand to the deed is likely also to suffer disaster. I admire you for your prudence.  For your cowardice I hate you. I will listen no less calmly when you praise me. Never fear to suffer that from me, at least. There is time enough in the future to decide that. Leave!  You have no power to help. No, I have it, but you lack the ability to listen and learn. Go, reveal everything to your mother! But, again, I do not hate you with so great a hate. Yet know at least to what dishonor you drive me. Dishonor, no!  It is forethought for you. Am I bound, then, to follow your rule of right? Yes, for when you are sensible, then at that time you shall lead the both of us. How terrible it is that one who speaks so well should be so wrong! You have well described the fault to which you devotedly cling. What?  Do you think that my words are not the words of Justice? But sometimes even Justice herself causes harm. I do not care to live where that attitude is lawful. Well, if you must do this, you will commend me yet. And do it I will, not a bit disturbed by you. Is this true?  You will not reconsider your plan? No, for no enemy is more damaging than bad advice. You seem to agree with nothing that I say. My resolve is not new, but long since fixed. Then I will go.  You cannot be brought to approve my words, nor I your conduct. No, go inside.  I will never come after you, even though you may strongly desire it, since it is great folly even to attempt a useless quest. Well, if you seem to think straight in your own eyes, may you go on thinking so.  Eventually, when you have fallen into trouble, you will approve my advice. Why, though we see the birds above, most thoughtful creatures, taking care for the sustenance of those from whom they derived life and enjoyment, why do we not pay these debts in like measure?  No, by the lightning-flash of Zeus, by Themis throned in the sky, we are not long unpunished.  O Voice of the underworld that reaches to mortals, shout for me a piteous cry to the sons of Atreus below.  Carry the reproaches not appropriate to my dancing! Tell them the affairs of their house, how it is now diseased;  how among his children, double-sided strife has overwhelmed their loving manner. Electra, betrayed, braves the storm alone. In misery she bewails her father’s fate\\n                        without pause, like the all-grieving nightingale. She cares not at all about\\n                        death, but is ready for that eternal blindness, could she but subdue the double Erinys of her house.  Who could grow to be so noble a daughter of so noble a father? None of the good willingly clouds his fair repute and becomes nameless by leading a corrupt life, my child. Similarly, you, too, have chosen a lifetime of shared mourning and have armed against dishonor, so that you might win in one breath a twofold praise as wise, and as the best of daughters. May I yet see you live exalted in might and wealth above your enemies by as much as you now dwell beneath their hand!  For I have found you enjoying no prosperous estate, yet for observance of nature’s highest laws you win the noblest prize by your reverence\\n                        toward Zeus. Ladies, have we been directed aright, and are we on the right path to our goal? What do you seek?  What desire brings you here? I have long been searching for the home of Aegisthus. Well, you have found it, and your guide is blameless. Which of you, then, would tell those inside of the long-desired presence of us travelers? She will, if the nearest in kin should announce it. Go, lady, enter and make it known that certain men of Ah, miserable me!  Surely you do not bring proof positive of that rumor which we heard? I know nothing of your What is it, sir?  Ah, how fear creeps over me! We come bearing his scanty remains in a small urn, as you see. Oh, the misery!  Here, at last, my eyes look for certain, it seems, upon that grievous burden in your hand. If your tears are for any of Orestes’ tribulations, know that this vessel is\\n                     his body’s home. Ah, sir, if this urn indeed contains him, then allow me, by the gods, to take it in my hands, so that I may weep and wail, not for these ashes alone, but for myself and for all our house with them! Take it and give it to her, whoever she may be.  For she asks this for herself not as if with hostile intent, but like one who is his friend, or a kinswoman by blood. Memorial of him whom I loved best on earth, sole remnant of Orestes’\\n                     vitality! How contrary to the hopes with which I sent you away do I receive you\\n                     back! Now I raise your nothingness in my hands; but then, my child, you were radiant, when I sent you away from home!  Would that I had first abandoned life, before, stealing you away with these hands, I sent you to a strange land and rescued you from death, in order that you might have lain dead on that same day and had your share in the tomb of our father! their sad burden from the all-consuming pyre, as was proper.  No!  At the hands of strangers, poor Orestes, you have been tended, and so have come to us, a small bulk in a small urn. on you in sweet labor! For you were never your mother’s darling so much as mine, nor was\\n                     any in the house your nurse but I, and by you I was ever called with your death.  Like a whirlwind you have swept everything away with you.  Our father is gone;  I am dead because of you;  you yourself are dead and gone;  our enemies laugh at us;  and our mother, who is no mother, raves with joy. Unknown to her, you often sent me messages about her, saying that you yourself would appear for vengeance.  But our evil fortune, yours and mine, has torn all that away, and has sent you back to me in this state, ash and a useless shade in place of your beloved form. Remember, Electra, you are the child of a mortal father, and Orestes was mortal.  Therefore do not grieve too much.  Death is a debt which all of us must pay. Ah, what shall I say?  I am at a loss.  To what words can I turn?  I no longer have the strength to master my tongue! What has troubled you?  Why did you say that? Is this the illustrious form of Electra? It is, though in a very wretched state. What pity, then, for this miserable fortune! Surely, stranger, you are not saddened like this on my account? O frame dishonorably, godlessly wasted! Those ills of which you speak, stranger, are none other’s than mine. Ah, pity for your unwed, ill-fated life! Why, stranger, do you stare and grieve in this way? How I knew nothing, it seems, of my own sorrows! What that has been said made you realize this? It was the sight of you conspicuous in your many sufferings. And yet you see but a few of my troubles. And how could there be any more odious to look on than these? Because I share house and table with the murderers. Whose murderers?  Where lies the guilt at which you point? The murderers of my father.  And, further, I am forced to slave for them. Who is it that binds you with this compulsion? She is called my mother, but in no respect is she like a mother. How does she do it?  By violence or by inflicting hardship? By violence and hardships and all manner of evil. And is there no one to help, or to prevent it? No one.  The one I had, his ashes you have put before me. Unfortunate girl, how seeing you stirs my pity! Then know that you are the first who ever pitied me. Yes,  for I alone have come and been pained by your troubles . Surely you are not some unknown kinsman? I would tell you, if these women bear you goodwill. Indeed they do, so you will speak to trustworthy companions. Give up this urn, then, and you shall know everything. No, by the gods, do not do this to me, stranger! Do as I say, and you will never be mistaken. No, I beg you, do not rip from me what I hold most dear! You must not keep it. Ah, what misery I will have because of you, Orestes, if I am robbed of your burial! Hush!  No ill-omened words!  You have no right to grieve. How is it not right for me to grieve for my dead brother? It is not proper for you to speak of him as you do. Am I so without rights in the dead? You are without rights in nothing;  but this burial is not your concern. Yes it is, if these are the remains of Orestes that I hold. They are not his, except inasmuch as fiction alone contrives to make them so. And where is that sufferer’s tomb? There is none;  the living have no tomb. What are you saying, boy? Nothing that is untrue. The man is alive? If there is life in me. What?  Are you he? Look at this signet, once our father’s, and know if I speak the truth. O blissful day! Blissful, I am your witness! Is this your voice? Hear it from no other. Do I hold you in my arms? May you hold me so always hereafter! Ah, dear friends and fellow-citizens, see Orestes here, who was dead by design, and now by design has come safely home! We see him, daughter, and for this happy turn of fortune a tear of joy trickles from our eyes. O seed, seed of the person to me most dear, you have just now come, you have come, and have found and seen her whom your heart desired! I am with you;  but keep silence and wait. What do you mean? It is better to be silent so that no one inside may hear. No, by ever-virgin Artemis, I will never think it right to tremble before eternally house-bound women, that useless burden on the ground! Yes, but remember that Ares dwells in women, too.  You know this well by experience, I believe. oh, no!  ah, me!  You have reminded me of my sorrow, one which by its nature cannot be veiled, cannot be done away with, cannot be forgotten! I know this, too;  but when occasion prompts, we must recall those crimes. Each moment of all time, as it comes, would be a proper occasion for me to make these just complaints.  Scarcely now have I had my lips set free. Yes, I agree;  therefore guard your freedom. What must I do? When it is inopportune, do not want to speak too much. No, who could exchange due silence for speech, when you have appeared?  For now my eyes have seen you, beyond all thought and hope! You saw me when the gods moved me to come. You have told me of a grace higher still than the first, if a god brought you to our house; I acknowledge in it the work of the divine. On the one hand I hesitate to curb your gladness, but on the other I fear that you may be overwhelmed by too much joy. O you who, after such a long time, saw fit to make your most happy journey and appear to me, do not, now that you have seen me in all my misery— What should I not do?— —Do not rob me of the comfort of your face;  do not force me to forego it! I would be angry, indeed, if I saw another attempt it. You give your consent? Why would I not? My friends, I heard a voice that I could never have hoped to hear;  nor could I have restrained my emotion in silence and without a cry, when I heard it. ah, me!  But now I have you.  You have appeared with that dear face, which I could never, even in misery, forget. Spare all superfluous words, and inform me neither of our mother’s\\n                     wickedness, nor how Aegisthus drains the wealth of our father’s house—what part he pours on the\\n                     ground and what he squanders at random. For the story would preclude you from\\n                     the opportunity afforded by the moment. Instead tell me that which will suit\\n                     our present circumstances: where, either openly or in ambush, we may put an end to our enemies’ laughter by means of my coming. Make sure that our\\n                     mother does not discover you by your radiant face, when we two have gone into\\n                     the house. Rather, make lament, as if for the feigned disaster. For when we\\n                     succeed, then there will be opportunity to rejoice and exult in freedom. Brother, be assured that my conduct will be as pleases you, since all my joy derives from you, and is not my own.  Nor would I consent to win a great good for myself at the cost of the slightest pain to you.  For in doing so I would not honorably support the divine power that attends us now. will ever see my face lit up with smiles.  My old hatred of her has been welded to my heart, and since I have seen you, for very joy I will never cease to weep.  How indeed could I stop when I have seen you come home on this one day  first as dead, and then in life?  What you have done to me is inconceivable—so much so that, if my father were to return to me alive, I would no longer think it a portent, but would believe that I truly saw him.  Therefore now that you have come to me by such a path, command me as your spirit bids you.  For had I been alone, I would not have failed in one of two things:  a noble salvation, or a noble destruction. Silence!  I hear someone walking inside as if to come out. Go in, strangers, especially since you bring a thing which no one could either turn away from these doors, or rejoice at receiving. Utterly foolish and senseless children!  Are you weary of your lives, or is there no wit inborn in you, that you do not see how you stand not on the brink, but in the very midst of immense danger?  Had I not long kept watch at these doors, your doings would have been in the house before your bodies.  But as it was, I put myself the task of averting that. Be done now with your long speeches and this insatiable shouting for joy, and go inside.  In dealings of this sort delay is harmful, but the time is ripe for being done. Then how will things inside stand when I enter? All is well.  The fact is that no one will know you. You have reported me as dead, I presume? Know that here you are a man numbered with the shades. Do they rejoice, then, at the news?  Or what do they say? I will tell when all is completed.  Meanwhile, all is favorable for us on their part, even that which is not favorable. Who is this, brother?  By the gods, tell me. Do you not know who he is? No, nor can I imagine. Do you not know the man to whose hands you gave me once? What man?  What do you mean? I mean him, by whose hands and through your forethought I was secretly conveyed away to Phocian soil. Is this he in whom alone out of many I once found a true ally at the time of\\n                     our father’s murder? This is he;  question me no further. O joyous day! O sole preserver of Agamemnon’s house, how did you come here?  Are you indeed the man who saved my brother and myself from many sorrows?  O dearest hands, O messenger whose feet were kindly servants!  How could you be with me so long and remain unknown, without giving a ray of illumination, but instead afflicting me with stories, while possessed of sweetest reality?  Welcome, Father, for it is a father that I seem to behold!  Welcome, and know that in one day I have hated you and loved you as no man ever before! That is enough, I think.  As for the recounting of intervening events, many are the circling nights and an equal number of days which will reveal them to you clearly, Electra. Pylades, in no way does our task call any longer for many words, but\\n                     rather demands that we enter the house immediately, after first adoring the\\n                     shrines of my father’s gods, the keepers of these gates. King Apollo!  Hear them with favor, and hear me besides, who so often have come before your altar with hands rich in such gifts as I could obtain!  And now, O Lycean Apollo, with what means I have I pray to you, I supplicate you, I implore you, be our ready champion in these designs, and show what rewards the gods bestow on humans in return for their impiety! Behold how Ares stalks onward, breathing bloody vengeance that is hard to oppose.  Just now have the hunters of wicked crimes passed beneath that roof there, the hounds which none may flee.  And so not long shall the vision of my soul hang in suspense. The champion of the spirits infernal is ushered on guileful feet into the house, the rich, ancestral palace of his father, and he bears keen-edged death in his hands.  My dearest friends, in a moment the men will do the deed.  But wait in silence. How do they fare?  What are they doing now? She is decking the urn for burial;  the two of them stand close to her. And why have you hurried out? To guard against Aegisthus entering before we are aware. Oh! Oh!  Our house is empty of friends and filled with murderers! Someone shouts inside.  Do you not hear, friends? I heard, ah, me, sounds unfit to be heard, and I shudder! Ah, misery!  Aegisthus, where, where are you? Look, once more someone cries out! My son, my son, have pity on your mother! Why?  You had none for him, nor for the father that begot him. Wretched city, wretched race, now the fate that has held you day by day perishes—it perishes! Oh, I am wounded! Stab her doubly, if you can! Ah, wounded again! Would that Aegisthus, too, were wounded! The curses bring fulfillment:  those who are buried live. For men long dead are draining their killers’ blood in a stream of requital. And now they are here!  The red hand drips with sacrifice to Ares, and I cannot blame the deed. Orestes, what happened? All is well within the house, if Apollo’s oracle spoke well. The miserable woman is dead? Have no more fear that your haughty mother will ever again trample on your rights. Quiet!  For I see Aegisthus in plain sight. You, young men, get back inside! Where do you see the man? He is at our mercy walking from the suburb, full of joy. Go with all speed to the vestibule, so that, just as your first task prospered, so this one again may prosper now. Have courage.  We will accomplish it. Hurry, then, to wherever you wish. See, I am gone. Things here will be my concern. It would be well to whisper into this man’s ear some few words of seeming\\n                        gentleness, so that he may rush blindly upon his trial before Justice. Which of you can tell me where those Phocian strangers are, who are said to have brought report for us that Orestes passed away amidst the shipwrecked chariots? You, you I ask, yes, you, who were in former days so bold.  It seems to me that this concerns you most, so you must know best, and can best tell me. I do know.  How could I not?  Otherwise I would be an alien to the fortune of my nearest kinsmen. Where, then, may the strangers be?  Tell me. Inside.  They have found a way to the heart of their hostess. Have they in fact reported him truly dead? No, not reported only.  They have shown him. Then I can identify the corpse myself? You can, indeed, though it is no enviable sight. You have indeed given me a joyful greeting, beyond your custom. May joy be yours, if joy is what you find in these things. Silence, I say, and throw wide the gates for all Mycenaeans and Argives to see, so that, if any one of them were once buoyed by empty hopes in this man, now by seeing his corpse, he may welcome my bit in his mouth, instead of waiting until my punishment makes him grow wits by force! All will be done on my part.  Time has given me the sense to comply with the stronger. O Zeus, I see an image which could not have fallen without divine spite—but, if Nemesis attend what I say, let it be unsaid! Lift the veil yourself.  It is not for me, but for you to look upon these remains and greet them kindly. You advise well, and I will obey you. She is near you;  do not look elsewhere. O, what sight is this! Why so scared?  Is the face so strange? Who are the men into whose nets I have miserably fallen? Do you not perceive how you have long been addressing the living in terms suited to the dead? Ah, I read the riddle!  It cannot be that this is not Orestes who speaks to me! And, though so good a prophet, were you deceived so long? Oh, I am destroyed, undone!  Yet allow me to speak just a little. By the gods, brother, do not allow him to speak any more or to plead at length! When mortals are embroiled in misfortunes, how can one who is to die benefit from lapse of time?  No, kill him as quickly as you can, and throw his corpse to the creatures from whom his kind should have burial, throw it far from our sight!  For in my eyes this alone can bring us release from the misery of the past.  Why take me into the house?  If this deed is just, what need is there of darkness?  Why is your hand not quick to strike? Do not give orders, but go to where you struck down my father, so that in that very place you may die. Is this dwelling doomed to see all the sufferings of us descendants of Pelops, both now and in time to come? Yours, at least.  I am for you a consummate prophet in these matters. The skill you boast about did not belong to your father. You bandy words, and our going is delayed.  Move forward! You lead. You must go first. Lest I escape you? No, lest you die in a manner which pleases you.  I must be sure that your death is bitter for you. This just penalty ought to come straightaway upon all who would break the laws:  the penalty of death.  Then wrongdoing would not abound. O seed of Atreus, through how many sufferings have you sprouted up at last in freedom, fulfilled by this day’s enterprise!  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  First, in this prayer of mine, I give the place of highest honor among the gods to the first prophet, Earth; and after her to Themis, for she was the second to take this oracular seat of her mother, as legend tells. And in the third allotment, with Themis’ consent and not by force, another Titan, child of Earth, Phoebe, took her seat here. She gave it as a birthday gift to Phoebus, who has his name from Phoebe. Leaving the lake he landed on Pallas’ ship-frequented shores, and came to this region and the dwelling places on And at his arrival, the people and Delphus, helmsman and lord of this land, made a great celebration for him. Zeus inspired his heart with prophetic skill and established him as the fourth prophet on this throne; but Loxias is the spokesman of Zeus, his father. These are the gods I place in the beginning of my prayer. And Pallas who stands before the temple ever since he, as a god, led the Bacchantes in war, and contrived for Pentheus death as of a hunted hare. I call on the streams of Pleistus and the strength of Poseidon, and highest Zeus, the Fulfiller; and then I take my seat as prophetess upon my throne. And may they allow me now to have the best fortune, far better than on my previous entrances. And if there are any from among the Hellenes here, let them enter, in turn, by lot, as is the custom. For I prophesy as the god leads. No! I will not abandon you. Your guardian to the end, close by your side or far removed, I will not be gentle to your enemies. So now you see these mad women overcome; these loathsome maidens have fallen asleep, old women, ancient children, with whom no god or man or beast ever mingles. They were even born for evil, since they live in evil gloom and in Tartarus under the earth, creatures hateful to men and to the Olympian gods. Nevertheless, escape and do not be cowardly. For as you go always over the earth that wanderers tread, they will drive you on, even across the wide mainland, beyond the sea and the island cities. Do not grow weary too soon, brooding on this labor, but when you have come to Pallas’ city, sit down and hold in your arms her ancient image. And there, with judges of your case and speeches of persuasive charm, we shall find means to release you completely from your labors. For I persuaded you to take your mother’s life. Lord Apollo, you know how to do no wrong; and, since you know this, learn not to be neglectful also. For your power to do good is assured. Remember, do not let fear overpower your heart. You, Hermes, my blood brother, born of the same father, watch over him; true to your name, be his guide, Sleep on! Aha! Yet what need is there of sleepers? It is due to you that I am thus dishonored among the other dead; because of those I killed the dead never cease to reproach me, and I wander in disgrace. I tell you that I am most greatly accused by them. And yet, although I have suffered cruelly in this way from my nearest kin, no divine power is angry on my behalf, slaughtered as I have been by the hands of a matricide. See these gashes in my heart, and from where they came! For the sleeping mind has clear vision, but in the daytime the fate of mortals is unforeseeable. I see all this trampled under foot. But he has escaped and is gone, like a fawn; lightly indeed, from the middle of snares, he has rushed away mocking at you. Hear me, since I plead for my life, awake to consciousness, goddesses of the underworld! For in a dream I, Clytaemestra, now invoke you. (whine) Whine, if you will! But the man is gone, fled far away. For he has friends that are not like mine! (whine) You are too drowsy and do not pity my suffering. Orestes, the murderer of me, his mother, is gone! (moan) You moan, you drowse—will you not get up at once? Is it your destiny to do anything other than cause harm? (moan) Sleep and toil, effective conspirators, have destroyed the force of the dreadful dragoness. Catch him! Catch him! Catch him! Catch him! Look sharp! In a dream you are hunting your prey, and are barking like a dog that never leaves off its keenness for the work. What are you doing? Get up; do not let fatigue overpower you, and do not ignore my misery because you have been softened by sleep. Sting your heart with merited reproaches; for reproach becomes a spur to the right-minded. Send after him a gust of bloody breath, shrivel him with the vapor, the fire from your guts, follow him, wither him with fresh pursuit! Awake! Wake her up, as I wake you.Still asleep? Get up, shake off sleep, let us see if any part of this beginning Oh, oh! Alas! We have suffered, friends. We have suffered very painfully, oh! an unbearable evil. The beast has escaped from our nets and is gone. Oh! Child of Zeus, you have become a thief— you, a youth, have ridden down old divinities—by showing respect to your suppliant, a godless man and cruel to a parent; although you are a god, you have stolen away a man that killed his mother. Reproach, coming to me in a dream, struck me like a charioteer with goad held tight, under my heart, under my vitals. I can feel the cruel, the very cruel chill of the executioner’s destroying scourge. They do such things, the younger gods, who rule, wholly beyond justice, a throne dripping blood, about its foot, about its head. Although he is a prophet, he has stained his sanctuary with pollution at its hearth, at his own urging, at his own bidding; against the law of the gods, he has honored mortal things and caused the ancient allotments to decay. And he brings distress to me too, but he shall not win his release; even if he escapes beneath the earth, he is never set free. A suppliant, he will acquire another avenger from his family. Out, I order you! Go away from this house at once, leave my prophetic sanctuary, so that you may not be struck by a winged glistening snake It is not right for you to approach this house;  no, your place is where the punishments are beheading, gouging out of eyes, cutting of throats, and where young men’s virility is ruined by destruction of seed; where there is mutilation and stoning, and where those who are impaled beneath their spine moan long and piteously. Do you hear what sort of feast is your delight? You are detested by the gods for it. The whole fashion of your form sets it forth. Creatures like you should live in the den of a blood-drinking lion, and not inflict pollution on all near you in this oracular shrine. Be gone, you goats without a herdsman! No god loves such a flock. Lord Apollo, hear our reply in turn. You yourself are not partially guilty of this deed; you alone have done it all, and are wholly guilty. What do you mean? Draw out the length of your speech this much. Through your oracle, you directed the stranger to kill his mother. Through my oracle, I directed him to exact vengeance for his father. What of it? And then you agreed to take the fresh blood on yourself. And I ordered him to turn for expiation to this house. And do you then rebuke us, the ones who escorted him here? Yes, for you are not fit to approach this house. But this has been assigned to us— What is this office of yours? Boast of your fine privilege! We drive matricides from their homes. But what about a wife who kills her husband? That would not be murder of a relative by blood. Then truly you dishonor and bring to nothing the pledges of Hera, the Fulfiller, and Zeus. Cypris too is cast aside, dishonored by this argument, and from her come the dearest things for mortals. For marriage ordained by fate for a man and a woman is greater than an oath and guarded by Justice. If, then, one should kill the other and you are so lenient as not to punish or visit them with anger, I claim that you unjustly banish Orestes from his home. For I see you taking the one cause very much to heart, but clearly acting more leniently about the other. But the goddess Pallas will oversee the pleadings in this case. I will never, never leave that man! Pursue him then and get more trouble for yourself. Do not cut short my privileges by your words. I would not take your privileges as a gift. No, for in any case you are called great at the throne of Zeus. But as for me—since a mother’s blood leads me, I will pursue my case against this man and I will hunt him down. And I will aid my suppliant and rescue him! For the wrath of the one who seeks purification is terrible among mortals and gods, if I intentionally abandon him. Lady Athena, at Loxias’ command I have come. Receive kindly an accursed wretch, not one who seeks purification, or with unclean hand, but with my guilt’s edge already blunted and worn away at other homes and in the travelled paths of men. Going over land and sea alike, keeping the commands of Loxias’ oracle, I now approach your house and image, goddess. Here I will keep watch and await the result of my trial. Aha! This is a clear sign of the man. Follow the hints of a voiceless informer. For as a hound tracks a wounded fawn, so we track him by the drops of blood. My lungs pant from many tiring struggles, for I have roamed over the whole earth, and I have come over the sea in wingless flight, pursuing him, no slower than a ship. And now he is here somewhere, cowering. The smell of human blood gives me a smiling welcome. Taught by misery, I know many purification rituals, and I know where it is right to speak and equally to be silent; and in this case, I have been ordered to speak by a wise teacher. For the blood is slumbering and fading from my hand, the pollution of matricide is washed away; while it was still fresh, it was driven away at the hearth of the god Phoebus by purifying sacrifices of swine. It would be a long story to tell from the beginning, how many people I have visited, with no harm from association with me. she will win me and my land and the aiding those whom she loves, or whether, like a bold marshal, she is surveying the Phlegraean No, neither Apollo nor Athena’s strength can save you from perishing abandoned, not knowing where joy is in your heart—a bloodless victim of the  gods below, a shadow. Living, you will be my feast, not slain\\n                  at an altar; now you will hear this hymn, a spell to bind you. Come now, let us also join the dance, since we are resolved to display our hated song and to declare our allotted office, how our party directs the affairs of men. We claim to be just and upright. No wrath from us will come stealthily to the one who holds out clean hands, and he will go through life unharmed; but whoever sins, as this man has, and hides his blood-stained hands, as avengers of bloodshed we appear against him to the end, presenting ourselves as upright witnesses for the dead. O mother Night, hear me, mother who gave birth to me as a retribution for the blind and the seeing. For Leto’s son dishonors me by snatching away this cowering wretch, a proper expiation for his mother’s blood. This is our song over the sacrificial victim—frenzied, maddened, destroying the mind, the Furies’ hymn, a spell to bind the soul, not tuned to the lyre, withering the life of mortals. For this is the office that relentless Fate spun for us to hold securely: when rash murders of kin come upon mortals, we pursue them until they go under the earth; and after death, they have no great freedom. This is our song over the sacrificial victim—frenzied, maddened, destroying the mind,the Furies’ hymn, a spell to bind the soul, not tuned to the lyre, withering the life of mortals. This office was ordained for us at birth; but the immortal gods must hold back their hands from us, nor does any of them share a feast in common with us; and I have neither lot nor portion of pure white ceremonial robes For I have chosen the overthrow of houses, whenever violence raised in the home seizes someone near and dear. So speeding after this man, we weaken him, even though he is strong, because of the fresh blood. We are eager to take these cares away from another, and to establish for the gods exemption from my concerns, so that it will not come to trial; for Zeus has considered us, a blood-dripping, hateful band, unworthy of his council. And men’s thoughts, very proud under the sky, waste away and dwindle in dishonor beneath the earth, at our attack in black robes and the vindictive dance of our feet. For surely with a great leap from above I bring down the heavily falling force of my foot, my limbs that trip even swift runners—unendurable ruin. But, as he falls, he does not know it, because of his senseless folly; pollution hovers over the man in such darkness, and mournful rumor speaks of a dark mist over his house. For it remains. We are skilled in plotting, powerful in execution, and we remember evil deeds; we are revered and hard for mortals to appease, pursuing our allotted office which is without rights, without honor, separated from the gods in sunless light—our office that makes the path rough for seeing and dim-sighted alike. What mortal, then, does not stand in awe and dread of this, when he hears from me the law ordained by Fate, given by the gods for perfect fulfilment? My ancient privilege still remains, I do not meet with dishonor, although I have my place under the earth and in sunless darkness. From afar I heard the call of a summons, from the Scamander, while I was taking possession of the land, which the leaders and chiefs of the Achaeans assigned to me, a great portion of the spoil their spears had won, to be wholly mine forever, a choice gift to Theseus’ sons. and you, who are like no race of creatures ever born, neither seen by gods among goddesses nor resembling mortal forms. But it is far from just to speak ill of one’s neighbor who is blameless, and Right stands aloof. Daughter of Zeus, you will hear it all in brief. We are the eternal children of Night. We are called Curses in our homes beneath the earth. I now know your family and the names by which you are called. You will soon learn my office. I shall understand, if someone would tell the story clearly. We drive murderers from their homes. And where is the end of flight for the killer? Where joy is absent and unknown. And would you drive this man with your shrieks to such  flight? Yes, for he thought it right to be his mother’s murderer. Through other compulsions, or in fear of someone’s wrath? Where is there a spur so keen as to compel the murder of a mother? Two parties are present; only half the case is heard. But he will not receive an oath nor does he want to give one. You want to be called just rather than to act justly. How so? Teach me. For you are not poor in subtleties. I say that oaths must not win victory for injustice. Well then, question him, and make a straight judgment. Then would you turn over the decision of the charge to me? How not?—since we honor you because you are worthy and of worthy parentage. What do you want to say to this, stranger, in turn? After you name your country and family and fortunes, then defend yourself against this charge; if indeed, relying on the justice of your case, you sit clinging to my image near my hearth, as a sacred suppliant, like Ixion. Lady Athena, first of all I will take away a great anxiety from your last words. I am not a suppliant in need of purification, nor did I sit at your image with pollution on my hands. I will give you strong proof of this. It is the law for one who is defiled by shedding blood to be barred from speech until he is sprinkled with the blood of a new-born victim by a man who can purify from murder. Long before at other houses I have been thus purified both by victims and by flowing streams. I am an mother killed him after she covered him in a crafty snare that still remains to witness his murder in the bath. And when I came back home, having been an exile in the time before, I killed the woman who gave birth to me, I will not deny it, as the penalty in return for the murder of my dearly-loved father. Together with me Loxias is responsible for this deed, because he threatened me with pains, a goad for my heart, if I should fail to do this deed to those who were responsible. You judge whether I acted justly or not; whatever happens to me at your hands, I will be content. The matter is too great, if any mortal thinks to pass judgment on it; no, it is not lawful even for me to decide on cases of murder that is followed by the quick anger of the Furies, especially since you, by rites fully performed, have come a pure and harmless suppliant to my house; and so I respect you, since you do not bring harm to my city. Yet these women have an office that does not permit them to be dismissed lightly; and if they fail to win their cause, the venom from their resentment will fall upon the ground, an intolerable, perpetual plague afterwards in the land. So stands the case: either course—to let them stay, to drive them out—brings disaster and perplexity to me. But since this matter has fallen here, I will select judges of homicide bound by oath, and I will establish this tribunal for all time. Summon your witnesses and proofs, sworn evidence to support your case; and I will return when I have chosen the best of my citizens, for them to decide this matter truly, after they take an oath that they will pronounce no judgment contrary to justice. Here is the overturning of new laws, if the wrongful cause of this matricide is to triumph. Now his deed will accustom all men to recklessness; many sorrowful wounds, given in truth by children, wait for parents in the future time. For the wrath of us, the Furies who keep watch on mortals, will not come stealthily upon such deeds—I will let loose death in every form. And as he anticipates his neighbor’s evils, one man will ask of another when hardship is to end or to decrease; and the poor wretch offers the vain consolation of uncertain remedies. Do not let anyone who is struck by misfortune make an appeal and cry aloud this word, may cry out these words piteously, now that the house of Justice is falling. There is a time when fear is good and ought to remain seated as a guardian of the heart. It is profitable to learn wisdom under strain. But who, if he did not train his heart in fear, either city or mortal, would still revere justice in the same way? Do not approve of a lawless life or one subject to a tyrant. The god grants power to moderation in every form, but he oversees other matters in different ways. I have a timely word of advice: arrogance is truly the child of impiety, but from health of soul comes happiness, dear to all, much prayed for. And as for the whole matter, I say to you: respect the altar of Justice and do not, looking to profit, dishonor it by spurning with godless foot; for punishment will come upon you. The appointed fulfilment remains. Therefore, let a man rightly put first in honor the reverence owed to his parents, and have regard for attentions paid to guests welcomed in his house. Whoever is just willingly and without compulsion will not lack happiness; he will never be utterly destroyed. But I say that the man who boldly transgresses, amassing a great heap unjustly—by force, in time, he will strike his sail, when trouble seizes him as the yardarm is splintered. He calls on those who hear nothing and he struggles in the midst of the whirling waters. The god laughs at the hot-headed man, seeing him, who boasted that this would never happen, exhausted by distress without remedy and unable to surmount the cresting wave. He wrecks the happiness of his earlier life on the reef of Justice, and he perishes unwept, unseen. Herald, give the signal and restrain the crowd; and let the piercing Tyrrhenian For while this council-hall is filling, it is good to be silent, and for my ordinances to be learned, by the whole city for everlasting time, and by these appellants, so that their case may be decided well. Lord Apollo, be master of what is yours. Say what part you have in this matter. I have come both to bear witness—for this man was a lawful suppliant and a guest of my sanctuary, and I am his purifier from bloodshed—and to be his advocate myself. I am responsible for the murder of his mother.  We are many, but we will speak briefly. I killed her. There is no denial of this. Of the three falls that win the wrestling match, this one is already ours. You make this boast over a man who is not down yet. You must, however, say how you killed her. I will say it: with drawn sword in hand, I stabbed her in the throat. By whom were you persuaded and on whose advice? By the oracles of this god here; he is my witness. The prophet directed you to kill your mother? Yes, and to this very hour, I do not blame my fortune. But if the jury’s vote catches hold of you, you’ll soon speak differently. I have good confidence. My father will send protection from his grave. Put your confidence in the dead now, after you have killed your mother! I do, for she was twice afflicted with pollution. How so? Teach the judges this. By murdering her husband, she killed my father. And so, although you are alive, she is free of pollution by her death. But why did you not drive her into exile, while she lived? She was not related by blood to the man she killed. Then am I my mother’s kin by blood? How else could she have nurtured you, murderer, beneath her belt? Do you reject the nearest kinship, that of a mother? Apollo, give your testimony now. Explain, on my behalf, whether I was justified in killing her. For I do not deny that I did it, as it is done. But decide whether this bloodshed was, to your mind, just or not, so that I may inform the court. I will speak justly before you, Athena’s great tribunal,— since I am a prophet, I cannot lie. I have never yet, on my oracular throne, said anything about a man or woman or city that Zeus, the father of the Olympians, did not command me to say. and I tell you to obey the will of my father; for an oath is not more powerful than Zeus. Zeus, as you say, gave you this oracular command, to tell Orestes here to avenge his father’s murder but to take no account at all of the honor due his mother? Yes, for it is not the same thing—the murder of a noble man, honored by a god-given scepter, and his murder indeed by a woman, not by rushing arrows sped from afar, as if by an Amazon, but as you will hear, Pallas, and those who are sitting to decide by vote in this matter. fettered her husband in an embroidered robe, and cut him down. This was his death, as I have told it to you—the death of a man wholly majestic, commander of the fleet. As for that woman, I have described her in such a way as to whet the indignation of the people who have been appointed to decide this case. Zeus gives greater honor to a father’s death, according to what you say; yet he himself bound his aged father, Cronus. How does this not contradict what you say? I call on you as witnesses Oh, monsters utterly loathed and detested by the gods! Zeus could undo fetters, there is a remedy for that, and many means of release. But when the dust has drawn up the blood of a man, once he is dead, there is no return to life. For this, my father has made no magic spells, although he arranges all other things, turning them up and down; nor does his exercise of force cost him a breath. See how you advocate acquittal for this man! After he has poured out his mother’s blood on the ground, shall he then live in his father’s house in Which of the public altars shall he use? What purification rite of the brotherhoods I will explain this, too, and see how correctly I will speak. The mother of what is called her child is not the parent, but the nurse of the newly-sown embryo. The one who mounts is the parent, whereas she, as a stranger for a stranger, preserves the young plant, if the god does not harm it.  And I will show you proof of what I say: a father might exist without a mother. A witness is here at hand, the child of Olympian Zeus, who was not nursed in the darkness of a womb, and she is such a child as no goddess could give birth to. so that he may be faithful for all time, and that you, goddess, might win him and those to come after him as a new ally and so that these pledges of faith might remain always, for the later generations of these people to cherish. Am I to assume that enough has been said, and shall I now command these jurors to cast an honest vote according to their judgment? For our part, every bolt is already shot. But I am waiting to hear how the trial will be decided. Why not? As for you, You have heard what you have heard; and as you cast your ballots, keep the oath sacred in your hearts, friends. Hear now my ordinance, people of And this Hill of Ares, the seat and camp of the Amazons, when they came with an army in resentment against Theseus, and in those days built up this new citadel with lofty towers to rival his, and sacrificed to Ares, from which this rock takes its name, the Hill of Ares: with filth, you will never find a drink. Stand in just awe of such majesty, and you will have a defense for your land and salvation of your city, such as no man has, either among the Scythians or in Pelops’ realm. I establish this tribunal, untouched by greed, worthy of reverence, quick to anger, awake on behalf of those who sleep, a guardian of the land. under the sacred obligation of your oath. My word has been spoken. And I counsel you not to dishonor us in any way, since our company can be a burden to your land. And I, for my part, command you to stand in fear of the oracles, both mine and Zeus’, and not cause them to be unfulfilled. Although it is not your office, you have respect for deeds of bloodshed. You will prophesy, dispensing prophecies that are no longer pure. Then was my father mistaken in any way in his purposes when Ixion, who first shed blood, was a suppliant? You do argue! But if I fail to win the case, I will once more inflict my company on this land as a burden. But you have no honor, among both the younger and the older gods. I will win. You did such things also in the house of Pheres, when you persuaded the Fates to make mortals free from death. Is it not right, then, to do good for a worshipper, especially when he is in need? It was you who destroyed the old dispensations when you beguiled the ancient goddesses with wine. Soon, when you have lost the case, you will spit out your venom—no great burden to your enemies. Since you, a youth, would ride me down, an old woman, I am waiting to hear the verdict in the case, since I have not decided whether to be angry at the city. It is my duty to give the final judgment and I shall cast my vote for Orestes. For there was no mother who gave me birth; and in all things, except for marriage, whole-heartedly I am for the male and entirely on the father’s side. Therefore, I will not award greater honor to the death of a woman who killed her husband, the master of the house. Orestes wins, even if the vote comes out equal. O Phoebus Apollo! How will the trial be decided? O Night, our dark Mother, do you see this? Now I will meet my end by hanging, or I will live. Yes, and we will be ruined, or maintain our honors further. Correctly count the ballots cast forth, friends, and be in awe of doing wrong in the division of the votes. Error of judgment is the source of much distress, and the cast of a single ballot has set upright a house. This man is acquitted on the charge of murder, for the numbers of the casts are equal. Pallas, savior of my house! I was deprived of a fatherland, and it is you who have given me a home there again. The Hellenes will say, that no captain of my land will ever come here and bring a well-equipped spear against them. For I myself, then in my grave, will accomplish it by failure without remedy, making their marches spiritless and their journeys \\n                  ill-omened, so that those who violate my present oath will repent their enterprise. But while the straight course is preserved, and they hold in everlasting honor this city of Pallas with their allied spears, I will be the more well-disposed to them. And so farewell—you and the people who guard your city. May your struggle with your enemies let none escape, bringing you safety and victory with the spear! Younger gods, you have ridden down the ancient laws and have taken them from my hands! And I—dishonored, unhappy, deeply angry—on this land, alas, I will release venom from my heart, venom in return for my grief, drops that the land cannot endure. From it, a blight that destroys leaves, destroys children—a just return—speeding over the plain, will cast infection on the land to ruin mortals. I groan aloud. What shall I do? I am mocked by the people. What I have suffered is unbearable. Ah, cruel indeed are the wrongs of the daughters of Night, mourning over dishonor! Be persuaded by me not to bear it with heavy lament. For you have not been defeated; the trial resulted fairly in an equal vote, without disgrace to you; but clear testimony from Zeus was present, and he himself who spoke the oracle himself gave witness that Orestes should not suffer harm for his deed. Do not be angry, do not hurl your heavy rage on this land, or cause barrenness, letting loose drops whose savage spirit will devour the seed. For I promise you most sacredly that you will have a cavernous sanctuary in a righteous land, where you will sit on shining thrones at your hearths, worshipped with honor by my citizens here. Younger gods, you have ridden down the ancient laws and have taken them from my hands! And I—dishonored, unhappy, deeply angry—on this land, alas, I will release venom from my heart, venom in return for my grief, drops that the land cannot endure. From it a blight that destroys leaves, destroys children—a just return—speeding over the plain, will cast infection on the land to ruin mortals. I groan aloud. What shall I do? I am mocked by the people. What I have suffered is unbearable. Ah, cruel indeed are the wrongs of the daughters of Night, mourning over dishonor! You are not dishonored; so, although you are goddesses, do not, in excessive rage, blight past all cure a land of mortals. I also rely on Zeus—what need is there to mention that?—and I alone of the gods know the keys to the house where his thunderbolt is sealed. But there is no need of that. So yield to my persuasion and do not hurl the words of a reckless tongue against the land, that all things bearing fruit will not prosper. Calm the black wave’s bitter anger, since you will receive proud honors and will live with me. And when you have the first-fruits of this great land forever, offerings on behalf of children and of marriage rites, you will praise my counsel. For me to suffer this, alas! For me, with ancient wisdom, to live beneath the earth, alas, without honor, unclean! I am breathing fury and utter rage. Oh, oh, the shame of it! What anguish steals into my breast! Hear my anger, mother Night; for the deceptions of the gods, hard to fight, have deprived me of my ancient honors, bringing me to nothing. I will endure your anger, for you are older, and in that respect you are surely wiser than I; yet Zeus has given me, too, no mean understanding. But as for you, if you go to a foreign land, you will come to love this land—I forewarn you. For time, flowing on, will bring greater honor to these citizens. And you, having a seat of honor at the house of Erechtheus, will obtain from hosts of men and women more than you could ever win from other mortals. So do not cast on my realm keen incentives to bloodshed, harmful to young hearts, maddening them with a fury not of wine; and do not, as if taking the heart out of fighting cocks, plant in my people the spirit of tribal war and boldness against each other. Let their war be with foreign enemies, and without stint for one in whom there will be a terrible passion for glory; but I say there will be no battling of birds within the home. It is possible for you to choose such things from me: bestowing good, receiving good, well honored in this land that is most beloved to the gods. For me to suffer this, alas! For me, with ancient wisdom, to live beneath the earth, alas, without honor, unclean! I am breathing fury and utter rage. Oh, oh the shame of it! What anguish steals into my breast! Hear my anger, mother Night; for the deceptions of the gods, hard to fight, have deprived me of my ancient honors, bringing me to nothing. No, I will not grow tired of telling you about these good things, so you will never be able to say that you, an ancient goddess, were cast out, dishonored and banished, from this land by me, a younger goddess, and by the mortal guardians of my city. But if you give holy reverence to Persuasion, the sweetness and charm of my tongue, then you might remain. But if you are not willing to stay, then surely it would be unjust for you to inflict on this city any wrath or rage or harm to the people. For it is possible for you to have a share of the land justly, with full honors. Lady Athena, what place do you say I will have? One free from all pain and distress; accept it. Say that I have accepted it, what honor awaits me? That no house will flourish without you. Will you gain for me the possession of such power? Yes, for we will set straight the fortunes of those who worship. And will you give me a pledge for all time? Yes, for I have no need to say what I will not accomplish. It seems you will win me by your spells; I am letting go my anger. Then stay in the land and you will gain other friends. What blessings then do you advise me to invoke on this land? Blessings that aim at a victory not evil; blessings from the earth and from the waters of the sea and from the heavens: that the breathing gales of wind may approach the land in radiant sunshine, and that the fruit of the earth and offspring of grazing beasts, flourishing in overflow, may not fail my citizens in the course of time, and that the seed of mortals will be kept safe. May you make more prosperous the offspring of godly men; for I, like a gardener, cherish the race of these just men, free of sorrow. this city victorious in the glorious contests of deadly war. I will accept a home with Pallas, and I will not dishonor a city which she, with Zeus the omnipotent and Ares, holds as a fortress of the gods, the bright ornament that guards the altars of the gods of to spring from the earth, in plenty. I act zealously for these citizens in this way, installing here among them divinities great and hard to please. For they have been appointed to arrange everything among mortals. Yet the one who has not found them grievous does not know where the blows of life come from. For the sins of his fathers drag him before them; destruction, in silence and hateful wrath, levels him to the dust, for all his loud boasting. May no hurtful wind blow to harm the trees—I declare my favor— and may no burning heat, stealing the buds from plants, pass the border of its proper place; may no deadly plague draw near to kill the fruit; may the earth nurture the thriving flocks with twin offspring at the appointed time; and may the rich produce of the earth always pay the gods’ gift of lucky gain. Do you hear, guards of my city, the things she will accomplish? For the lady Erinys is very powerful, both with the deathless gods and with those below the earth; and in their dealings with mankind, they accomplish matters visibly, perfectly; to some giving songs, to others a life made dim by tears. I forbid deadly and untimely fate for men; grant to lovely maidens life with a husband, you that have the rightful power; you, divine Fates, our sisters by one mother, divinities who distribute justly, who have a share in every home, and whose righteous visitations press heavily at every season, most honored everywhere among the gods! I am glad that they are zealously accomplishing these things for my land; and I am grateful to Persuasion, that her glance kept watch over my tongue and mouth, when I encountered their fierce refusal. But Zeus of the assembly has prevailed. in doing good is victorious forever. I pray that discord, greedy for evil, may never clamor in this city, and may the dust not drink the black blood of its people and through passion cause ruinous murder for vengeance to the destruction of the state. But may they return joy for joy in a spirit of common love, and may they hate with one mind; for this is the cure of many an evil in the world. Do they not then intend to find the path of good speech? From these terrible faces I see great profit for these citizens; for, if you always greatly honor with kindness the kindly ones, you will surely be pre-eminent, keeping your land and city in the straight path of justice. Farewell, farewell, in the wealth allotted to you by fate. Farewell, people of the city, seated near to Zeus, the beloved of the beloved maiden, learning at last the way of wisdom. The Father stands in awe of you, since you are under Pallas’ wings. Farewell to you also; but I must lead the way to show you your dwellings by the sacred light of these, your escorts. You who hold the city, children of Cranaus, Farewell, farewell, again, I repeat, all you in the city, both gods and mortals, living in Pallas’ city; if you duly revere my residence among you, you will not blame the chances of life. I approve the words of your invocation, and will escort you by the light of gleaming torches to the places below and beneath the earth, with the attendant women who guard my image in duty bound. For the eye of the whole land of Theseus will come forth, a glorious troop of children, matrons and a band of old women. so that this kindly company of visitors to our land may show itself afterwards in blessings that bring prosperity to men. Go on your way to your home, children of Night: mighty, lovers of honor, children, yet aged, under kindly escort— you who dwell in the land, refrain from inauspicious speech! Under the primeval caverns of the earth, gaining the high honor of worship and sacrifice—all you people, refrain from inauspicious speech! Gracious and favorable to the land, come here, venerable goddesses, with flame-fed torch, rejoicing as you go—cry aloud now in echo to our song! Peace endures for all time between Pallas’ citizens and these new dwellers here. Zeus who sees all and Fate have come down to lend aid—cry aloud now in echo to our song!  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                          I have come from out of the charnel-house and gates of gloom, where Hades dwells apart from gods, I Polydorus, a son of Hecuba, the daughter of Cisseus, and of Priam. Now my father, when was threatened with destruction by the spear of And with me my father sent much gold by stealth, so that, if ever to carry weapons or to wield the spear. So long then as the bulwarks of our land stood firm, and at the court of the Thracian, my father’s guest-friend. But when then my father’s friend killed me, his helpless guest, for the sake of the gold, and then cast me into the swell of the sea, to keep the gold for himself in his house. And there I lie, at one time upon the strand, at another in the salt sea’s surge, drifting ever up and down upon the billows, unwept, unburied; but now I am hovering over the head of my dear mother Hecuba, a disembodied spirit, keeping my airy station these three days, ever since my poor mother came from Meanwhile all the Achaeans sit idly here in their ships at the shores of demanding to have my sister Polyxena offered at his tomb, and to receive his reward. And he will obtain this prize, nor will they that are his friends refuse the gift; and on this very day fate is leading my sister to her doom. So will my mother see two children dead at once, me and that ill-fated maid. For I, to win a grave, ah me! will appear among the rippling waves before her servant-maid’s feet. Yes! I have begged this from the powers below, to find a tomb and fall into my mother’s hands. So shall I have my heart’s desire; but now I will get out of the way of aged Hecuba, for here she passes on her way from the shelter of Agamemnon’s tent, terrified at my spectre. Alas! O mother, from a palace to face a life of slavery, how sad your lot, as sad as once it was blessed! Some god is now destroying you, setting this in the balance to outweigh your former bliss. Guide these aged steps, my servants, forth before the house; guide and support your fellow-slave, once your queen, you maids of and I will lean upon your bent arm as on a staff and quicken my halting footsteps onwards. O dazzling light of Zeus! O gloom of night! why am I thus scared by fearful visions of the night? O lady Earth, mother of dreams that fly on sable wings! I am seeking to avert the vision of the night, the sight of horror which I learned from my dreams about my son, who is safe in the last and only anchor of my house, now settled in Such ceaseless thrills of terror never wrung my heart before. Oh! where, you Trojan maidens, can I find inspired Helenus or Cassandra, that they may read me my dream? For I saw a dappled deer mangled by a wolf’s bloody fangs, torn from my knees by force, piteously. And this too filled me with fear; over the summit of his tomb appeared Achilles’ phantom, and for his prize he would have one of the luckless maids of Hecuba, I have hastened away to you, leaving my master’s tent, where the lot assigned no, I have laden myself with heavy news, and am a herald of sorrow to you, lady. It is said the Achaeans have determined in full assembly to offer your daughter in sacrifice to Achilles; for you know how one day he appeared standing on his tomb in golden armor, and stayed the sea-borne ships, though they had their sails already hoisted, with this pealing cry: There was Agamemnon, all eagerness in your interest, because of his love for the frenzied prophetess; but the two sons of Theseus, scions of for they said they never would set Cassandra’s bed before Achilles’ valor. Now the zeal of the rival disputants was almost equal, until that shifty, smooth-mouthed liar, the son of for want of a servant-maid’s sacrifice, nor have it said by any of the dead that stand beside Persephone that the Danaids have left the plains of for their companions who died for at Agamemnon’s knees sit as a suppliant! Invoke the gods, both those in heaven and those beneath the earth. For either your prayers will avail to spare you the loss of your unhappy child, or you must see your daughter fall before the tomb, her crimson blood spurting in deep dark jets from her neck encircled with gold. Woe, woe is me! What words, or cries, or lamentations can I utter? Ah me! for the sorrows of my closing years! for slavery too cruel to endure, to bear! Woe, woe is me! What champion do I have? Family, and city—where are they? Aged Priam is no more; no more my children now. Which way am I to go, either this or that? Where shall I turn my steps? Where is any god or divine power to come to my aid? Ah, Trojan maids! bringers of evil tidings! Messengers of woe! you have made an end, an utter end of me; life on earth has no more charm for me. Oh! luckless steps, lead on, guide your aged mistress here to the tent. My child, daughter of a most wretched woman, come forth; listen to your mother’s voice. Oh! mother, mother, why do you call so loud? what news is it you have proclaimed, scaring me, like a cowering bird, from my chamber by this alarm? Alas, my daughter! Why this ominous address? it means sorrow for me. Woe for your life! Tell it, hide it no longer. Ah mother! how I dread, I dread the import of your loud laments. Ah my daughter! a luckless mother’s child! Why do you tell me this? The Argives with one consent are eager for your sacrifice to the son of Peleus at his tomb. Ah! my mother! how can you speak of such a dire mischance? Tell me all, mother, yes all! It is an ill-boding rumor I tell, my child; they bring me word that sentence is passed upon your life by the Argives’ vote. Alas, for your cruel sufferings, my persecuted mother! woe for your life of grief! What grievous outrage has some fiend sent on you, hateful, horrible? No more shall I your daughter share your bondage, hapless youth on hapless age attending. For you, alas! will see me, your hapless child, torn from your arms like a calf of the hills, and sent beneath the  darkness of the earth with severed throat for Hades, where with the dead shall I be laid, ah me! For your unhappiness I weep with plaintive wail, mother; but for my own life, its ruin and its outrage, never a tear I shed; no, death has become to me a happier lot than life. See where Odysseus comes in haste, to announce some fresh command to you, Hecuba. Lady, I think you know already the intention of the army, and the vote that has been passed; still I will declare it. It is the Achaeans’ will to sacrifice your daughter Polyxena at the mound heaped over Achilles’ grave; and they appoint me to take the maid and bring her there, while the son of Achilles is chosen to preside over the sacrifice and act as priest. Do you know then what to do? Do not be forcibly torn from her, nor match your might against mine; recognize the limits of your strength, and the presence of your troubles. Even in adversity it is wise to yield to reason’s dictates. Alas! a dreadful trial is near, it seems, full of mourning, rich in tears. Yes, I too escaped death where death had been my due, and Zeus did not destroy me but is still preserving my life, that I may witness in my misery fresh sorrows surpassing all before. But if the bond may ask the free of things that do not grieve them or wrench their heart-strings, you ought to speak in answer to my questions and I ought to hear what you have to say. Granted; put your questions; I do not grudge you that delay. Do you know when you came to spy on disguised in rags and tatters, while down your cheek ran drops of blood? I do; for it was no slight impression it made upon my heart. Did Helen recognize you and tell me only? I well remember the great risk I ran. Did you embrace my knees in all humility? Yes, so that my hand grew dead and cold upon your robe. Was it I that saved and sent you forth again? You did, and so I still behold the light of day. What did you say then, when in my power? Doubtless I found plenty to say, to save my life. Are not you then playing a sorry part to plot against me thus, after the kind treatment you by your own confession received from me, showing me no gratitude but all the ill you can? A thankless race! all you who covet honor from the mob for your oratory. Oh that you were unknown to me! you who harm your friends and think no more of it, if you can say a word to win the mob. But tell me, what kind of cleverness did they think it, when against this child they passed their bloody vote? Was it duty that led them to slay a human victim at the tomb, where sacrifice of oxen is more fitting? or does Achilles, if claiming the lives of those who slew him as his recompense, show his justice by marking her out for death? No! she at least never injured him. He should have demanded Helen as a victim at his tomb, for she it was that proved his ruin, bringing him to and her injury to him was proved no less than ours. Against the justice of his plea I pit this argument. Now hear the recompense due from you to me at my request. On your own confession, you fell at my feet and embraced my hand and aged cheek; I in my turn now do the same to you, and claim the favor then bestowed; and I implore you, do not tear my child from my arms or slay her; there are dead enough. In her I take delight and forget my sorrows; she is my comfort in place of many a loss, my city and my nurse, my staff and journey’s guide. It is not right that those in power should use it out of season, or, when prosperous, suppose they will be always so. For I also was prosperous once, but now my life is lived, and one day robbed me of all my bliss. Friend, by your beard, have some regard and pity for me; go to after dragging them from the altars. For among you the same law holds good for slave and free alike respecting bloodshed; such a reputation as yours will persuade them even though its words are weak; for the same argument, when proceeding from those of no account, has not the same force as when it is uttered by men of mark. Human nature is not so stony-hearted as to hear your plaintive tale and catalogue of sorrows, without shedding a tear. O Hecuba, be schooled by me, and do not in your angry mood count him a foe who speaks wisely. Your life I am prepared to save, for the service I received; I do not say otherwise. But what I said to all, I will not now deny, that after because he asked a victim. For here is a source of weakness to many states, whenever a man of brave and generous soul receives no greater honor than his inferiors. Now Achilles, lady, deserves honor at our hands, since on behalf of to be an object of respect, for this gratitude has long to run. You speak of cruel sufferings; hear my answer. Among us are grey old women and men no less miserable than you, and brides bereft of gallant husbands, over whom this Trojan dust has closed. Endure these sorrows; for us, if we are wrong in resolving to honor the brave, we shall bring upon ourselves a charge of ignorance; but as for you barbarians, do not regard your friends as such and pay no homage to your gallant dead, so that Alas! how cursed is slavery always in its nature, forced by the might of the stronger to endure unseemly treatment. Daughter, my pleading to avert your bloody death was wasted idly, hurled forth on the air; but you, if endowed with greater power than your mother, make haste to utter every pleading note like the tuneful nightingale, to save your soul from death. Throw yourself pitiably at Odysseus’ knees, and try to move him—here is your plea: he too has children—to feel pity for your sad fate. Odysseus, I see you hiding your right hand beneath your robe and turning away your face, so that I may not touch your beard. Take heart; you are safe from the suppliant’s god in my case, for I will follow you, both because I must and because it is my wish to die; for if I were unwilling, a coward would I show myself, a woman faint of heart. Why should I prolong my days? I whose father was lord of all the Phrygians, my chiefest pride in life. Then I was nursed on fair hopes to be a bride for kings, the center of keen jealousy among suitors, to see whose home I would make my own; and over each lady of Ida I was queen; ah me! admired among maidens, equal to a goddess, save for death alone, but now I am a slave! That name first makes me long for death, so strange it sounds; and then perhaps my lot might give me to some savage master, one that would buy me for money—me the sister of Hector and many others—who would make me knead him bread within his halls, or sweep his house or set me working at the loom, leading a life of misery; while some slave, bought I know not where, will taint my bed, once deemed worthy of royalty. No, never! Here I close my eyes upon the light, free as yet, and dedicate myself to Hades. Lead me away, Odysseus, and do your worst, for I see nothing within my reach to make me hope or expect with any confidence that I am ever again to be happy. Mother, do not seek to hinder me by word or deed, but join in my wish for death before I meet with shameful treatment undeserved. For whoever is not used to taste of sorrows, though he bears it, yet it galls him when he puts his neck within the yoke; far happier would he be dead than alive, for life bereft of honor is toil and trouble. A wondrous mark, most clearly stamped, does noble birth imprint on men, and the name goes still further where it is deserved. A noble speech, my daughter! but there is sorrow linked with its noble sentiments. Odysseus, if you must please the son of Peleus, and avoid reproach, do not slay this maid, but lead me to Achilles’ pyre and torture me unsparingly; it was I that bore It is not your death, my lady, that Achilles’ ghost has demanded of the Achaeans, but hers. At least then slaughter me with my child; so shall there be a double drink of blood for the earth and the dead that claims this sacrifice. The maiden’s death suffices; no need to add a second to the first; would we did not need even this! Die with my daughter I must and will. How so? I did not know I had a master. I will cling to her like ivy to an oak. Not if you will listen to those who are wiser than you. Be sure I will never willingly relinquish my child. Well, be equally sure I will never go away and leave her here. Mother, listen to me; and you, son of Will you be thrown to the ground, be roughly thrust aside and wound your aged skin, and in unseemly fashion be torn from me by youthful arms? This you will suffer; but do not, for it is not right for you. No, my dear mother! give me your beloved hand, and let me press your cheek to mine; for never again, but now for the last time, shall I behold the dazzling sun-god’s orb. Take my last farewells now. O mother, my mother! I pass beneath the earth. O my daughter, I am still to live and be a slave. Unwedded I depart, never having tasted the married joys that were my due! Yours, my daughter, is a piteous lot, and sad is mine also. There in Hades’ courts shall I lie apart from you. Ah me, what shall I do? where shall I end my life? Daughter of a free-born father, a slave I am to die. Not one of all my fifty children left! What message can I take for you to Hector or your aged lord? Tell them that of all women I am the most miserable. Ah! breasts and paps that fed me with sweet food! Oh, my daughter—your wretched, untimely fate! Farewell, my mother! farewell, Cassandra! You too, my brother Polydorus, in Yes, if he lives, which I doubt; so luckless am I in every way. He lives; and, when you die, he will close your eyes. I am dead; sorrow has forestalled death here. Come veil my head, Odysseus, and take me away; for now, before the fatal blow, my heart is melted by my mother’s wailing, and hers by mine. O light of day! for still I may call you by your name, though now my share in you is only the time I take to go between Achilles’ tomb and the sword. Alas! I faint; my limbs sink under me. O my daughter, embrace your mother, stretch out your hand, give it to me; do not leave me childless! Ah, friends! it is my death-blow. Oh! to see that Spartan woman, Helen, sister of the sons of Zeus, in such a plight; for her bright eyes have caused the shameful fall of O breeze, breeze of the sea, that wafts swift galleys, ocean’s coursers, across the surging main! Where will you bear me, the sorrowful one? To whose house shall I be brought, to be his slave and chattel? to some haven in the Dorian land, or in Or to an island home, sent on a  voyage of misery by oars that sweep the brine, leading a wretched existence in halls where the first-created palm and the bay-tree put forth their sacred shoots for dear the golden head-band and bow of Artemis, their goddess? Or in the city of Pallas, the home of Athena of the lovely chariot, shall I then upon her saffron robe yoke horses, embroidering them on my web in brilliant varied shades, or the race of Titans, put to sleep by Zeus the son of Cronos with bolt of flashing flame? Alas for my children! alas for my ancestors, and my country which is falling in smouldering ruin among the smoke, sacked by the shore am called a slave, indeed!  leaving Where can I find Hecuba, who once was queen of There she lies near you, Talthybius, stretched full length upon the ground, wrapped in her robe. O Zeus! what can I say? that your eye is over man? or that we hold this opinion all to no purpose, and she, a slave in her old age, her children dead, lies upon the ground, soiling her wretched head in the dust. Ah! old as I am, may death be my lot before I am caught in any shameful mischance. Arise, poor lady! lift up yourself and raise that white head. Oh! who are you that will not let my body rest? Why disturb me in my anguish, whoever you are? I, Talthybius, have come, the servant of the Danaids; Agamemnon has sent me for you, lady. Good friend, have you come because the Achaeans are resolved after all to slay me too at the grave? How welcome your tidings would be! Let us hasten and lose no time; please lead the way, old man. I have come to fetch you to bury your daughter’s corpse, lady; and those that send me are the two sons of Atreus and the Achaean people. Alas! What will you say? Have you not after all come to fetch me to my doom, but to announce ill news? Lost, my child! snatched from your mother’s arms! and I am childless now, at least as regards you; ah, woe is me! How did you end her life? was any mercy shown? or did you deal ruthlessly with her as though your victim were a foe, old man? Speak, though your words must be pain to me. Lady, you wish me to have a double benefit of tears in pity for your child; for now too as I tell the sad tale my eyes will be wet, as they were at the tomb when she was dying. All and a chosen band of young Achaeans followed to hold your child and prevent her struggling. Then Achilles’ son took in his hands a brimming cup of gold and raised in his hand an offering to his dead father, making a sign to me to proclaim silence throughout the Achaean army. So I stood at his side and in their midst proclaimed, warriors to hold the maid. But she, when she perceived it, uttered this speech: Then the people shouted their applause, and king Agamemnon told the young men to let go the maid. displaying a breast and bosom fair as a statue’s; then sinking on her knee, one word she spoke more piteous than all the rest, Then he, half glad, half sorry in his pity for the maid, cut with the steel the channels of her breath, and streams of blood gushed forth; but she, even in death, took good heed to fall with grace, hiding from the gaze of men what must be hidden. When she had breathed her last through the fatal gash, no and heaping up a pyre; and the one who brought nothing would hear from him who did such taunts as these, Upon the race of Priam and my city some fearful curse has burst; it is sent by God, and we must bear it. O my daughter! among this crowd of sorrows I do not know where to turn my gaze; for if I set myself to one, another will not let me be; while from this again another grief summons me, finding a successor to sorrow’s throne. And now I can not efface from my mind the memory of your sufferings sufficiently to stay my tears; yet the story of your noble death has taken from the keenness of my grief. Is it not then strange that a poor land, when blessed by heaven with a lucky year, yields a good crop, while that which is good, if robbed of needful care, bears little fruit; yet among men the base is nothing else but wicked, the good man is good, never changing for the worse because of misfortune, but ever the same? Is then the difference due to birth or bringing up? Good training doubtless gives lessons in good conduct, and if a man has mastered this, he knows what is shameful by the standard of the good. And these are random shafts from my mind, I know.  that they do not touch my daughter’s body but keep the crowd away. For when a countless army is gathered, the mob knows no restraint, and the unruliness of sailors exceeds that of fire, all abstinence from crime being counted criminal.  and dip it in the salt sea and bring it here, that I for the last time may wash my child, an unwed bride, a ravished virgin, and lay her out, as she deserves, ah! how can I? impossible! but as best I can; and what will that amount to? I will collect adornment from the captives, my companions in these tents, if perhaps any of them escaping her new master’s eye has made some theft from her home. O Priam, rich in store of fairest wealth, most blessed of fathers, and I no less, the grey-haired mother of your race, how are we brought to nothing, stripped of our former pride! And in spite of all we vaunt ourselves, one on the riches of his house, another because he has an honored name among his fellow-citizens! But these things are nothing; in vain are all our thoughtful schemes, in vain our boastful words. He is happiest who meets no sorrow day by day. Woe and tribulation were made my lot in life, when Alexander first cut his beams of pine in Ida’s woods, to sail across the heaving sea in quest of Helen’s bed, loveliest woman on whom the sun-god turns his golden eye. For here begins trouble’s cycle, and, worse than that, relentless fate; and from one man’s folly came a universal curse, bringing death to the land of Simois, with trouble from an alien shore. The strife the shepherd decided on Ida, between three daughters of the blessed gods, brought as its result war and bloodshed and the ruin of my home; and many a Spartan maiden too is weeping bitter tears in her halls on the banks of fair Eurotas, and many a mother whose sons are slain, is smiting her gray head and tearing her cheeks, making her nails bloody in the furrowed gash. Oh! ladies, where is Hecuba, our queen of sorrow, who conquers all in tribulation, men and women both alike? No one shall dispute the crown with her. What now, unhappy one with your cry of misery? Your evil tidings never seem to rest. It is to Hecuba I bring my bitter news; no easy task is it for mortal lips to speak smooth words in sorrow. Look, she is coming even now from the shelter of the tent, appearing just in time to hear you speak. O mistress, most hapless beyond all words of mine to tell; you are ruined, you no longer exist, though you are alive; of children, husband, city bereft; hopelessly undone! This is no news but insult; I have heard it all before. But why have you come, bringing here to me the corpse of Polyxena, on whose burial She knows nothing, but mourns Polyxena, not grasping her new sorrows. Ah! woe is me! you are surely not bringing here frenzied Cassandra, the prophetic maid? You speak of the living; but the dead you do not weep is here. is not this a sight to fill you with wonder, and upset your hopes? Ah me! it is the corpse of my son Polydorus I behold, whom the Thracian man was keeping safe for me in his halls. Alas! this is the end of all; my life is over. alas! I now begin the laments, a frantic strain I learned just now from some avenging fiend. What! so you knew your son’s fate, poor lady? I cannot, cannot credit this fresh sight I see. One woe succeeds to another; no day will ever pass without groans and tears. Alas! poor lady, our sufferings are cruel indeed. O  my son, child of a luckless mother, what was the manner of your death? by what fate do you lie here? by whose hands? I do not know. I found him on the sea-shore. Cast up on the smooth sand, or thrown there after the murderous blow? The waves had washed him ashore. Alas! alas! I now know the vision I saw in my sleep; the dusky-winged phantom did not escape me, the vision I saw of you, my son, now no more within the bright sunshine. Who slew him then? Can your dream-lore tell us that? It was my own familiar friend, the knight of O horror! what will you say? did he slay him to get the gold? O dreadful crime! O deed without a name! beyond wonder! impious! intolerable! Where are the laws between guest and host? Accursed of men! how have you mangled his flesh, slashing the poor child’s limbs with ruthless sword, lost to all sense of pity! Alas for you! how some deity, whose hand is heavy on you, has sent you troubles beyond all other mortals! But I see our lord and master Agamemnon; so let us be still from now on, my friends. Hecuba, why are you delaying to come and bury your daughter? for it was for this that Talthybius brought me your message begging that no one of the Argives should touch your child. And so we granted this, and are not touching her, but this delay of yours fills me with wonder. And so I have come to send you from here; for our part there is well performed—if here there is any place for  that the garments it is clad in tell me. Unhappy one! in naming you I name myself; Hecuba, what shall I do? throw myself here at Agamemnon’s knees, or bear my sorrows in silence? Why do you turn your back towards me and weep, refusing to say what has happened? Who is this? But if he should count me as a slave and foe and spurn me from his knees, I would add to my anguish. I am no prophet born; therefore, if I am not told, I cannot learn the current of your thoughts. Can it be that in estimating this man’s feelings I make him out too ill-disposed, when he is not really so? If your wish really is that I should remain in ignorance, we are of one mind; for I have no wish myself to listen. Without his aid I shall not be able to avenge my children. Why do I still ponder the matter? I must do and dare whether I win or lose. What is your desire? to be set free? that is easily done. Not that; give me vengeance on the wicked, and I am willing to lead a life of slavery forever. Well, but why do you call me to your aid? It is a matter you little know of, king. Do you see this corpse, for whom my tears now flow? I do; but what is to follow, I cannot guess. He was once my child; I bore him in my womb. Which of your sons is he, poor sufferer? Not one of Priam’s race who fell beneath Did you indeed have another son besides those, lady? Yes, the one you see here, of whom it seems I have small gain. Where then was he, when his city was being destroyed? His father, fearful of his death, conveyed him out of Where did he place him apart from the sons he then had? In this very land, where his corpse was found. With Polymestor, the king of this country? He was sent here in charge of gold, most bitter trust! By whom was he slain? What death overtook him? By whom but this man? His Thracian host slew him. The wretch! could he have been so eager for the gold? Just so, when he heard of the Phrygians’ disaster. Where did you find him? or did some one bring his corpse? This woman, who happened upon it on the sea-shore. Was she seeking it, or bent on other tasks? She had gone to fetch water from the sea to wash Polyxena. It seems then his host slew him and cast his body out to sea. Yes, for the waves to toss, after mangling him in this way. Woe to you for your measureless troubles! I am ruined; no evil now is left, Agamemnon. Ah! what woman was ever born to such mischance? There is no one, unless you would name Chance herself. But hear my reason for throwing myself at your knees. If my treatment seems to you deserved, I will be content; but, if otherwise, help me to punish this most godless host, fearless alike of gods in heaven or hell, who has done a most unholy deed; who, though often he had shared my board and been counted first of all my guest-friends meeting with every kindness he could claim—. And receiving my consideration, he slew my son, and bent though he was on murder, did not think it right to bury him, but cast his body forth to sea. I may be a slave and weak as well, but the gods are strong, and Custom too which prevails over them, for by custom it is that we believe in them and set up boundaries of right and wrong for our lives. Now if this principle, when referred to you, is to be set at nothing, and they are to escape punishment who murder guests or dare to plunder the temples of gods, then all fairness in human matters is at an end. Consider this then a disgrace and show regard for me, have pity on me, and, like an artist standing back from his picture, look on me and closely scan my piteous state. I was once a queen, but now I am your slave; a happy mother once, but now childless and old alike, bereft of city, utterly forlorn, the most wretched woman living.  but Persuasion, the only real mistress of mankind, we take no further pains to master completely by offering to pay for the knowledge, so that any man could convince his fellows as he pleased and gain his point at once? How shall anyone hereafter hope for prosperity? All those my sons are gone from me, and she, my daughter, is a slave and suffers shame. I am lost; I see the smoke leaping over my city. Further—though this is perhaps idly urged, to plead your love, still I will put the case—at your side lies my daughter, Cassandra, the inspired maiden, as the Phrygians call her. How then, king, will you acknowledge those nights of rapture, or what return shall my daughter or I her mother have for the love she has lavished on her lord? I have only one thing yet to urge. Oh! would I had a voice in arms, in hands, in hair and feet, placed there by the arts of Daedalus or some god, that all together they might with tears embrace your knees, bringing a thousand pleas to bear on you! O my lord and master, most glorious light of and to punish evil-doers wherever found. It is strange how each extreme meets in human life! Custom determines even our natural ties, making the most bitter foes friends, and regarding as foes those who formerly were friends. Hecuba, I feel compassion for you and your son and your ill-fortune, as well as for your suppliant gesture, and I would gladly see that impious host pay you this forfeit for the sake of heaven and justice, if I could only find some way to help you without appearing to the army to have plotted the death of the Thracian king for Cassandra’s sake. For on one point I am assailed by perplexity: the army count this man their friend, the dead their foe; that he is dear to you is a matter apart, in which the army has no share. Reflect on this; for though you find me ready to share your toil and quick to lend my aid, yet the risk of being reproached by the Achaeans makes me hesitate. Ah! there is not in the world a single man free; for he is a slave either to money or to fortune, or else the people in their thousands or the fear of public prosecution prevents him from following the dictates of his heart. But since you are afraid, deferring too much to the rabble, I will rid you of that fear. Thus: be aware of my plot if I devise mischief against this murderer, but refrain from any share in it. And if any uproar or attempt at rescue breaks out among the Achaeans, when the Thracian is suffering his doom, check it without seeming to do so on my account. For what remains—take heart—I will arrange everything well. How? what will you do? will you take a sword in your old hand and slay the barbarian, or do you have drugs or some means to aid you?  Who will take your part? Where will you procure friends? Sheltered beneath these tents is a crowd of Trojan women. Do you mean the captives, the booty of the Hellenes? With their help I will punish my murderous foe. How are women to master men? Numbers are a fearful thing, and joined to craft a desperate foe. True; still I have a mean opinion of the female race. What? did not women slay the sons of  the burial of Polyxena lately slain, so that brother and sister may be laid on the same pyre and buried side by side, a double cause of sorrow to their mother. So shall it be; yet if the army were able to sail, I could not have granted you this favor; but as it is, for the god sends forth no favoring breeze, the army must wait and look for a calm voyage. Good luck to you, for this is the interest alike of individual and state, that the wrong-doer be punished and the good man prosper. No more, my native you are shorn of your crown of towers, and fouled most piteously with filthy soot; no more, ah me! shall I tread your streets. It was in the middle of the night my ruin came, in the hour when sleep steals sweetly over the eyes after the feast is done. After the music and dancing, my husband had brought the sacrifice to an end and was lying in our bridal-chamber, his spear hung on a peg; with never a thought of the sailor-throng encamped upon the Trojan shores. And I was braiding my tresses beneath a tight-drawn head-band before my golden mirror’s countless rays, so that I might lie down to rest; when through the city rose a din, and a cry went ringing down the streets of I left my bed, wearing only a tunic, like a Dorian girl, and sought in vain, ah me! to station myself at the holy hearth of Artemis; for, after seeing my husband slain, I was led away over the broad sea; with many a backward look at my city, when the ship began her homeward voyage and parted me from Cursing Helen the sister of the Dioscuri, and for it was their marriage, which was no marriage but misery sent by some demon, that robbed me of my country and drove me from my home. Oh! may the sea’s salt flood never carry her home again; and may she never set foot in her father’s halls! My dear friend Priam, and you no less, Hecuba, I weep to see you and your city thus, and your daughter lately slain. Ah! there is nothing to be relied on; fair fame is insecure, nor is there any guarantee that prosperity will not be turned to woe. For the gods confound our fortunes, tossing them to and fro, and introduce confusion, so that our perplexity may make us worship them. But what use is it to lament these things, and make no advance ahead of trouble? If you are blaming me at all for my absence, stop a moment; I happened to be away in the very heart of just as I was starting from my home for the same purpose, your maid fell in with me, and gave me your message, which brought me here at once. Polymestor, I am held in such wretchedness that I blush to meet your eye; for my present evil case makes me ashamed to face you who saw me in happier days, and I could not look on you with unfaltering gaze. Do not then think it ill-will towards you, Polymestor; there is another cause as well, I mean the custom which forbids women to meet men’s gaze. No wonder, surely. But what need do you have of me? Why did you send for me to come here from my house? I wish to tell you and your children a private matter of my own; please bid your attendants withdraw from the tent. Retire; this desert spot is safe enough. is to help its unlucky friends; for I am ready to do so. First tell me of the child Polydorus, whom you are keeping in your house, received from me and his father; is he alive? The rest I will ask you after that. Yes, you still have a share in fortune there. Well said, dear friend! how worthy of you! What next would you learn of me? has he any recollection of me his mother? Yes, he was longing to steal away here to you. Is the gold safe, which he brought with him from Safe under lock and key in my halls. Do save it, but do not desire your neighbor’s goods. Not I; may I benefit by what I have, lady! Do you know what I wish to say to you and your children? No; your words will declare it. O you who are as dear to me as you now are, there are— What is it that I and my children must learn? Ancient vaults filled full of gold by Priam’s ancestors. Is it this you would tell your son? Certainly, through you; for you are a righteous man. What need then of these children’s presence? It is better they should know it, in case of your death. Well said; it is also the wiser way. Then do you know where the shrine of Trojan Athena is? Is the gold there? what is there to mark it? A black rock rising above the ground. Is there anything else you want to tell me about the place? I wish to keep safe the treasure I brought from Where can it be? inside your dress, or have you hidden it? It is safe among a heap of spoils within these tents. Where? This is the station built by the Achaeans to surround their fleet. The captive women have huts of their own. It is safe to enter? are there no men about? There are no Achaeans within; we women are alone. Enter then the tent, for the Argives are eager to set sail from Not yet have you paid the penalty, but perhaps you will. Like one who slips and falls into the surge with no haven near, so shall you lose your own life for the life you have taken. For where liability to justice coincides with heaven’s law; there is ruin full of death and doom. Your hopes of this journey shall cheat you, for it has led you, unhappy wretch! to the halls of death; and to no warrior’s hand shall you resign your life. O horror! I am blinded of the light of my eyes, ah me! Did you hear, friends, that Thracian’s cry of woe? O horror! horror! my children! 0 the cruel blow. Friends, there is strange mischief afoot in yo. No, you shall never escape for all your hurried flight; for with a blow I will burst open the inmost recesses of this building. Hark! how he launches a bolt with weighty hand! Shall we force an entry? The crisis calls on us to aid Hecuba and the Trojan women. Strike on, spare not, burst the doors! you shall never replace bright vision in your eyes or see your children, whom I have slain, alive again. What! have you foiled the Thracian stranger and is he in your power, mistress? Is all your threat now brought to pass? A moment, and you shall see him before the tent, blind, advancing with blind random step; and the bodies of his two children whom I with my brave women of from the hot fury of the Thracian, my deadly foe. Woe is me! where can I go, where halt, or turn? shall I crawl like a wild four-footed beast on their track, as my reward? Which path shall I take first, this or that, eager as I am to clutch those Trojan murderesses that have destroyed me? You wretched, cursed daughters of Ha! hush! I catch the stealthy footsteps of the women here. Where can I dart on them and gorge on their flesh and bones, making for myself a wild beasts’ meal, inflicting mutilation in requital of their outrage on me? Ah, woe is me! where am I rushing, leaving my children unguarded for maenads of hell to mangle, to be murdered and ruthlessly cast forth upon the hills, a feast of blood for dogs? Where shall I stay or turn my steps, like a ship that lies anchored at sea, gathering close my linen robe and rushing to that chamber of death, to guard my children? Woe to you! what grievous outrage has been done to you! a fearful penalty for your foul deed Woe is me! Ho! my Thracian spearmen, armed, a race of knights whom Ares inspires! Ho! Achaeans! sons of Atreus! To you I loudly call; come here, by the gods! Does any one hearken, or will no one help me? Why do you delay? Women, captive women have destroyed me. A fearful fate is mine; ah me! my hideous outrage! Where can I turn or go? Shall I take wings and soar aloft to the mansions of the sky, where Orion and Sirius dart from their eyes a flash as of fire, or shall I, in my misery, plunge to Hades’ murky flood? It is pardonable, for a man suffering from evils too heavy to bear, to rid himself of a wretched existence. Hearing a cry I have come here; for Echo, child of the mountain-rock, has sent her voice loud-ringing through the army, causing a tumult. If we had not known that Best of friends! for by your voice I know you, Agamemnon; do you see my piteous state? What! hapless Polymestor, who has stricken you? who has blinded your eyes, staining the pupils with blood? who has slain these children? whoever he was, fierce must have been his wrath against you and your children. Hecuba, helped by the captive women, has destroyed me—not destroyed, far worse than that. What do you say? Was it you that did this deed, as he says? You, Hecuba, that have ventured on this inconceivable daring? Ha! what is that? is she somewhere near? Show me, tell me where, that I may grip her in my hands and rend her limb from limb, bespattering her with gore. You creature, what are you about? By the gods I entreat you, let me vent on her the fury of my arm. Hold! banish that savage spirit from your heart and plead your cause, so that after hearing you and her in turn I may fairly decide what reason there is for your present sufferings. I will tell my tale. There was a son of Priam, Polydorus, the youngest, a child by Hecuba, whom his father Priam sent to me from suspecting no doubt the fall of and the Achaeans, knowing that a son of Priam survived, might bring another expedition against the Phrygian land, and then harry and lay waste these plains of Now Hecuba, having discovered the death of her son, brought me here on the following pretext, saying she would tell me of hidden treasure stored up in So I sat down on a couch in their midst to rest; for there were many of the Trojan maidens seated there, some on my right hand, some on my left, as if beside a friend; and they were praising the weaving of our Edonian handiwork, looking at this robe as they held it up to the light; while others examined my Thracian spear and so stripped me of two-fold protection. And those that were young mothers were dandling my children in their arms, with loud admiration, as they passed them on from hand to hand to remove them far from their father; and then after their smooth speeches—would you believe it?—in an instant snatching daggers from somewhere in their dress they stab my children; while others, like foes, seized me hand and foot; and if I tried to raise my head, anxious to help my children, they would clutch me by the hair; while if I stirred my hands, I could do nothing, poor wretch! for the numbers of the women. At last they did a fearful deed, worse than what had gone before; for they took their brooches and stabbed the hapless pupils of my eyes, making them gush with blood, and then fled through the chambers; up I sprang like a wild beast in pursuit of the shameless murderesses, searching along each wall with hunter’s care, dealing buffets, spreading ruin. This then is what I have suffered because of my zeal for you, Agamemnon, for slaying an enemy of yours. But to spare you a lengthy speech, if any of the men of former times have spoken ill of women, if any does so now, or shall do so hereafter, I will say all this in one short sentence; for neither land or sea produces such a race, as whoever has had to do with them knows. Curb your bold tongue, and do not, because of your own woes, thus embrace the whole race of women in one reproach. Never ought words to have outweighed deeds in this world, Agamemnon. No! if a man’s deeds were good, so should his words have been; if, on the other hand, evil, his words should have been unsound, instead of its being possible at times to speak injustice well. There are, it is true, clever persons, who have made a science of this, but their cleverness cannot last for ever; a miserable end awaits them; no one ever yet escaped. This part of my prelude belongs to you. Now will I turn to this fellow, and will give you your answer, you who say it was to save the barbarian race would never be friends with your country’s crops? Whom do you expect to persuade into believing that? If you would only speak the truth, it was the gold that slew my son, and your greedy spirit. Now tell me this: why, when when Priam was alive, and Hector’s warring prospered, why did you not then, if you were really minded to do Agamemnon a service, slay the child, for you had him in your palace beneath your care, or bring him with you alive to the Argives? But when the enemy took us from the light and our city made a signal by its smoke, you murdered the guest who had come to your hearth. Furthermore, to prove your villainy, hear this; if you were really a friend to those Achaeans, you should have brought the gold, which you say you are keeping not for yourself but for this man, and given it to them, for they were in need and had endured a long exile from their native land. But not even now can you bring yourself to part with it, but persist in keeping it in your palace. Again, had you kept my son safe and sound, as your duty was, a fair renown would have been your reward, for it is in trouble’s hour that the good most clearly show their friendship; though prosperity by itself in every case finds friends. If you were in need of money and he were prosperous, that son of mine would have been as a mighty treasure for you to draw upon; but now you have him no longer to be your friend, and the benefit of the gold is gone from you, your children too, and you yourself are in this sorry plight. not devout, not just; while I shall say you delight in evil-doers, being such a one yourself; but I do not abuse my masters. Ah! how a good cause always affords men an opening for a good speech. To be judge in a stranger’s troubles goes much against my grain, but still I must; yes, for to take this matter in hand and then put it from me is a shameful course. My opinion, that you may know it, is that it was not for the sake of the Achaeans or me that you killed your guest, but to keep that gold in your own house. In your trouble you make a case in your own interests. Perhaps among you it is a light thing to murder guests, but with us in I could not. No, since you endured your horrid crime, endure as well its painful consequence. Woe is me! worsted by a woman and a slave, I am, it seems, to suffer by unworthy hands. Is it not just for your atrocious crime? Ah, my children! ah, my blinded eyes! woe is me! You grieve; but what of me? Do you think I do not grieve for my son? You wicked wretch! Is your delight in mocking me? Yes, for I am avenged on you; have I not cause for delight? It will soon cease, when ocean’s flood— Shall convey me to the shores of No, but will close over you when you fall from the masthead. Who will force me to take the leap? Of your own accord you will climb the ship’s mast. With wings upon my back, or by what means? You will become a dog with bloodshot gaze. How did you know of my transformation? Dionysus, our Thracian prophet, told me so. And did he prophesy to you nothing of your present trouble? No, for you would never have caught me thus by guile. Dead or alive shall I complete my life here? Dead; and to your tomb shall be given a name—; Recalling my form, or what will you tell me? It is nothing to me, now that you have paid me the penalty. Further, your daughter Cassandra must die. I scorn the prophecy! I give it to you to keep for yourself. The wife of Agamemnon, grim keeper of his palace, shall slay her. Never may the daughter of Tyndareus do such a frantic deed! And she shall slay this man as well, lifting high the axe. You creature, are you mad? are you so eager to find sorrow? Kill me, for in Ho! servants, drag away him from my sight! Do my words pain you? Stop his mouth! Close it now; for I have spoken. Make haste and cast him upon some desert island, since his mouth is full of such exceeding presumption. Go, unhappy Hecuba, and bury your two corpses; and you, Trojan women, must draw near your masters’ tents, for lo! I perceive a breeze just rising to waft us home. May we reach our country well and find all well at home, released from troubles here! Away to the harbour and the tents, my friends, to prove the toils of slavery! for such is fate’s relentless hest.  \n",

are the lovely pure streams of the living on the island of Pharos and lord of and a noble daughter, her mother’s pride, called Eido in her infancy. But when she came to youth, the season of marriage, she was called Theonoe; for she knew whatever the gods design, both present and to come, having received this honor from her grandfather Nereus. My own fatherland, which accomplished the deceitful union, fleeing the pursuit of an eagle, if this story is true. My name is Helen; I will tell the evils I have suffered. For the sake of beauty, three goddesses came to a deep valley on Hera and Kypris, and the virgin daughter of Zeus, wishing to have the judgment of their loveliness decided. Kypris offered my beauty, if misfortune is beautiful, for and came to But Hera, indignant at not defeating the goddesses, made an airy nothing of my marriage with and he thinks he has me—an idle fancy, for he doesn’t have me. And in turn the plans of Zeus added further troubles to these; for he brought a war upon the land of the Hellenes and the unhappy Phrygians, so that he might lighten mother earth of her crowded mass of mortals, and bring fame to the bravest man of hid me in a cloud—for Zeus was not neglectful of me—and he set me down here in the house of Proteus, having selected the most self-controlled of all mankind, so that I might keep my bed pure for Menelaos. And so I am here, while my wretched husband has gathered an army and gone over to the towers of and brought a great war to the Hellenes. Why then am I still alive? I heard the god Hermes declare that I would yet live in the glorious country of Well, as long as Proteus saw this light of the sun, I was safe from marriage; but now that he is hidden in the dark earth, the dead man’s son hunts after a marriage with me. But I, out of regard to my husband of long ago, am throwing myself down as a suppliant before this tomb of Proteus, for him to keep my bed safe for my husband, so that, if I bear a name infamous throughout Who holds power over this fortified house? The dwelling is worthy of comparison with Ploutos’, its royal enclosures and towering buildings. Ah! Oh gods, what sight is here? I see the hateful deadly likeness of the woman who ruined me and all the Achaeans. May the gods spurn you, so much do you look like Helen! If I were not in a foreign land, you would have died by this well-aimed arrow as a reward for your likeness to the daughter of Zeus. What is it, poor man—who are you, that you have turned away from me and loathe me for the misfortunes of that one? I was wrong; I gave way to my anger more than I should, for all Who are you? Where have you come from, to visit this land? I am one of those unfortunate Achaeans, lady. Then it is no wonder that you loathe Helen. But who are you and where do you come from? Whose son should I call you? My name is Teucer, my father is Telamon, and Then why are you visiting these lands of the I am an exile, driven out of my native land. You must be unhappy! Who banished you from your fatherland? My father Telamon. Could you find anyone closer to me? But why? This matter is surely an unfortunate one. The death of my brother Aias at How so? You didn’t take his life with your sword, did you? He threw himself on his own sword and died. Was he mad? For what sensible man would dare such a thing? Do you know a certain Achilleus, the son of Peleus? Yes; he came to woo Helen once, so I hear. When he died, he left a contest for his armor to his allies. Well, if he did, what harm is this to Aias? When someone else got the arms, he took his own life. Then are you ill through his suffering? Yes, because I did not die together with him. So you went to the famous city of Yes, and by helping to sack it, I destroyed myself as well. Has it already been set alight and completely consumed by fire? So that not even a trace of the walls is evident. O miserable Helen! Because of you, the Phrygians have been destroyed. And also the Achaeans; great evils have been committed. How long is it since the city was sacked? Almost seven years have gone full circle, with their harvests. And how much longer were you waiting at For many months; the moon held its course through ten years. And did you capture the Spartan woman? Menelaos caught her by the hair to drag her away. Did you yourself see the wretched creature? Or do you speak from hearsay? I saw her with my own eyes, just as I see you, no less. Consider whether you had some fancy, sent by the gods. Think of some other topic, not that woman still! Are you so sure this fancy was reliable? I saw it with my own eyes; and the mind has sight. Is Menelaos already at home with his wife? No; he is neither in Alas! This is evil news for those to whom you bring it. He is said to have disappeared with his wife. Wasn’t there the same passage for all the Argives? Yes; but a tempest scattered them in every direction. On which surface of the salty ocean? While they were crossing the And from that time does no one know of Menelaos’ arrival? No one; but throughout I am wholly lost. Is the daughter of Thestius alive? You speak of Leda? She is dead and gone, indeed. It wasn’t Helen’s disgraceful fame that killed her, surely? Yes, they say she tied a noose around her noble neck. Are the sons of Tyndareus still alive or not? They are dead, and not dead: it is a double story. Which report is the stronger? I am so unhappy at these evils! Men say that they are gods in the likeness of stars. That is good news; but what is the other story? That they killed themselves because of their sister. But enough of such talk! I do not need to grieve twice. As to why I came to this royal palace, wanting to see the prophetess Theonoe, you be my patron, so I might obtain an oracle: how I should steer a favorable course to the island of The voyage itself will explain that, stranger; leave this land and escape, before the son of Proteus, the ruler of this land, catches sight of you; now he is away with his trusty hounds tracking his savage quarry to the death; for he kills every visitor from Lady, you have spoken well. May the gods grant you a return for your kindness! Although you have a body like Helen’s, your heart is not like hers, but very different. May she die miserably, and never reach the streams of Eurotas! But may you always have good fortune, lady. Oh, as I begin the great lament of my great distress, what mourning shall I strive to utter? or what Muse shall I approach with tears or songs of death or woe? Alas! Winged maidens, virgin daughters of Earth, the Sirens, may you come to my mourning with Libyan flute or pipe or lyre, tears to match my plaintive woes; grief for grief and mournful chant for chant, may Persephone send choirs of death in harmony with my lamentation, so that she may receive as thanks from me, in addition to my tears, a paean for the departed dead beneath her gloomy roof. Beside the deep-blue water and on the tangled grass, I happened to be drying purple robes in the sun’s golden blaze near the young reed shoots; from my mistress, from where she cried aloud her misery, I heard a sound, a mournful song not fit for the lyre, because she was then shrieking, lamenting with her wails; just as a Naiad nymph, who sends a song of woe ringing over the hills, cries out, under the rocky hollows, with screams at the rape of Pan. Oh! Oh! Maidens of came, he came bringing tears upon tears to me. Leda sought death by hanging, in anguish over my disgrace. My husband, after much wandering in the sea, has died and is gone; and Castor and his brother, twin glory of their native land, have vanished, vanished, leaving the plains that shook to their galloping horses, and the schools of reed-fringed Eurotas, scene of youthful labors. Alas, alas! for your mournful fate and destiny, lady! You were fated, fated to have a life full of pain, when Zeus begot you on your mother, shining through the air on the wings of a snow-white swan. What evil is not yours? What life have you not endured? Your mother is dead; the twin beloved sons of Zeus do not enjoy happiness; and you do not see your fatherland, while through the cities a rumor goes, mistress, which hands you over to the bed of a barbarian; your husband has lost his life in the salty waves, and never again will you bring glee to your father’s halls and Athene of the Bronze House. Ah! Who was it, either from or from Hellas, who cut the pine that brought tears to to my home, to that most ill-fated beauty, to win me as his wife; and with him sailed deceitful and murderous Kypris, bearing death for the Danaans. Oh, unhappy in my misfortune! But Hera, the holy beloved of Zeus on her golden throne, sent the swift-footed son of so that I might go to the goddess of the Bronze House; he carried me off through the air to this luckless land, and made me an object of miserable strife, of strife between beside the streams of Simois bears a false rumor. You have sorrows, I know; but it is best to bear as lightly as we can the necessary evils of life. Dear friends, to what a fate am I yoked? Did my mother bear me as a wonder to mankind? My life and all I do is a wonder, partly because of Hera, and partly my beauty is to blame. If only I could be rubbed out like a painting, and have again in turn a plainer form instead of beauty, and the Hellenes would have forgotten the evil fate that I now have, and would remember what part of my life is not evil, as they now remember what is. When someone looks to one event only, and is ill-treated by the gods, it is hard, but all the same it can be borne. But I am involved in countless troubles. First, although I never acted wrongly, my good name is gone. And this trouble is stronger than the reality, if someone incurs blame for wrongs that are not his own. Next, the gods have removed me from my native country to barbarian habits, and bereft of friends I have become a slave although I am free by birth; for among barbarians all are slaves except one. And the only anchor of my fortunes is gone, the hope that my husband would come one day and free me of my woes—he is dead, he no longer exists. My mother is dead, and I am called her murderer—unjustly, but that injustice is mine to bear; while the one who was born the glory of the house, my daughter, is growing gray as a virgin, without a husband; and those two Dioskouroi, called the sons of Zeus, are no more. But with all my misfortunes, I am as good as dead in my circumstances, though not in fact. And this is the last evil of all: if ever I should come home, I would be shut out by barred doors, for people would think I was that Helen of If my husband were still alive, we could have recognized each other by recourse to tokens which are evident to us alone. But now this is not so, and he can never be saved. Why then do I still live? What fortune do I have left? Shall I choose marriage in exchange for evils, and live with a barbarian man, seated at his sumptuous table? But whenever a husband she hates lives with a woman, her own body is also hateful to her. It is best to die; how could this not be well done? but the same thing has destroyed me. Helen, do not suppose that stranger who came here, whoever he was, has spoken the whole truth. And yet he said very clearly that my husband was dead. Many words might be said in falsehood also. And the opposite of falsehood is clear in its truth. You are carried towards misfortune instead of what is good. Yes, for terror has embraced me and leads me to the thing I fear. How much goodwill is there in this house for you? All are my friends, except the one who hunts me in marriage. Then do you know what you should do? Leave your seat at the monument— What sort of word of advice are you coming to? Go inside and question the daughter of the sea-nymph, Theonoe, who knows all things, about your husband, whether he is still alive, or has left the light of day; and when you know for certain, rejoice or be full of mourning, according to your fortune. Before you know anything correctly, what good would it do you to grieve? But be persuaded by me; leave this tomb and join the girl; when you have someone in this house from whom you can learn the whole truth, why do you look further? And I myself want to go in and ask about the prophecies of the maiden with you; for, truly, women ought to help each other. Dear friends, I welcome your advice. Come in, come into the house, to learn within about my struggles. You are calling on one who is wholly willing. Oh, what an unhappy day! What tearful word shall I hear, unhappy as I am? Do not be a prophetess of sorrow, dear friend, anticipating lamentation. What has my poor husband suffered? Does he see the light and the sun’s chariot and the paths of the stars? Or does he have a lasting fate among the dead beneath the earth? Take a brighter view of the future, whatever will happen. For I call on you, I swear to you, Eurotas green with watery reeds, if this rumor of my husband’s death is true—and what was obscure in those words?—I will stretch a deadly noose about my neck, or drive inward a murderous thrust of slaughter that gushes from the throat, a contest of the blade through my flesh, as a sacrifice to the three goddesses and to the son of Priam, who once sat on the hollows of Ida, near the ox-stalls. May sorrow be turned aside elsewhere, and may your lot be fortunate! Oh, unhappy and many tears; it has added grief to grief and tear to tear, sorrows. . . . Mothers have lost their children and virgin sisters of the slain have cut off their hair by the swollen tide of Phrygian Skamandros. And O maiden Kallisto, blessed once in and also the one whom Artemis once drove from her chorus, as a deer with horns of gold, the Titan girl, daughter of Merops, because of her loveliness; but the beauty of my body has destroyed the Dardanian towers, it has destroyed them and the lost Achaeans. O Pelops, who once held that chariot-race contest with Oinomaos over before you ever begot my father, Atreus, to whom were born, from his marriage with Airope, Agamemnon and myself, Menelaos, a famous pair; for I believe that I carried a mighty army—and I say this not in boast—in ships to no tyrant commanding any troops by force, but leading the young men of But I wander miserably over the swelling waves of the gray ocean, ever since I sacked the towers of and whenever I draw near my native land, the blast drives me back again, and no favoring wind has ever entered my sails to let me come home. And now I am cast up on this shore, a miserable shipwrecked sailor who has lost his friends; and my ship is broken into many pieces against the rocks. But out of its cleverly-wrought fastenings the keel was left, on which I made my difficult escape by an unexpected chance, and also Helen with me, whom I dragged away from and its people; for I was embarrassed to burst into a crowd and make inquiries, and so I concealed these shabby clothes, in shame over my misfortune. For whenever a man of high degree is badly off, he falls into an unaccustomed state which is worse than that of one who has long been unfortunate. But poverty is wearing me away; for I have neither food, nor clothes around my body; one can compare what I am wearing to rags cast out of the ship. The sea snatched away all the robes I once wore, splendid clothes and ornaments. Deep in a cave I hid the woman who caused all my troubles, and have come here, after compelling those of my friends who survived to guard my wife. I have come alone, seeking help for those friends there, if I may find it somehow after careful search. When I saw this home, surrounded by walls, and the majestic gateways of some prosperous man, I came near; sailors can hope to get something from wealthy homes; but from those who have no livelihood—they could not help us, even if they wanted to. Hello! Is there some gatekeeper who might come from the house and announce my troubles within? Who’s at the door? Get away from the house and don’t annoy my master by standing at the court-yard gate! Or else you will die because you are a Hellene, and they have no business here. My good woman, you can say these same words in a different tone, for I shall be persuaded; but let go your angry speech. Go away! Stranger, my orders are to let no Hellene come near this house. Ah! Do not push me, or thrust me away by force. You are to blame, for not heeding what I say. Announce to your master inside— I think someone would be sorry, if I announced your words. I come as a shipwrecked man and a guest; such people are safe from violence. Well, go to some other house instead of this one. No; I am going inside. You listen to me. Know that you’re only causing trouble; and soon you’ll be thrown out by force. Alas! Where are those glorious armies of mine? Perhaps you were grand somewhere, but not here. O my fortune, how we have been unworthily dishonored. Why are your eyes wet with tears? To whom are you lamenting? To my fortunes, which were happy before this. Well then, why don’t you go away and give these tears to your friends. What is this land? Whose palace is this? Proteus lives here, the land is And why do you blame the bright gleam of the I do not blame it; I am sighing for my fate. Many people are doing badly; you are not the only one. Is the king you name in the house? This is his tomb; his son rules the land. And where might he be? Abroad, or in the house? He is not inside; he is most bitterly opposed to the Hellenes. What cause does he have? I have felt the consequences of it! Helen, the daughter of Zeus, is in this house. What do you mean? What did you say? Tell me again. The daughter of Tyndareus, who once lived in Where did she come from? What is the meaning of this? She came here from the land of Lakedaimon. When? Surely I have not been robbed of my wife from the cave? Before the Achaeans went to catches you, death will be your guest-gift. For I am well-disposed to Hellenes, for all that I spoke harshly to you in fear of my master. What can I say? For after my former troubles, this present event that I hear of is an unhappy one, if I have come here, bringing my wife who was taken from Can there be a man with the name of Zeus by the banks of Is there any land of the same name as Lakedaimon or Besides, I will not run away from a servant’s fears; for no man is so barbaric at heart as to refuse me food when he has heard my name. The fire of I will wait for the master of the house; he gives me two things to look out for: if he is a cruel sort of person, I will keep myself hidden and go back to the shipwreck; but if he shows any softening, I will ask for help in my present state. This is the worst evil for me in my misery, to beg the means of life from other kings, when I am myself a king; but it is necessary. The saying is not mine, but it is a wise word: nothing is stronger than dreadful necessity. I have heard the prophetic maiden, who gave a clear answer within the palace: Menelaos is not yet dead and buried, gone to the land of shadows where darkness takes the place of light; but he is still wearing out his life on the ocean swell and has not yet reached the haven of his country, wretched in his wandering life, bereft of every friend, approaching every land in his sea-going ship from the land of Here I am, once again coming back to the sanctuary of this tomb, after learning the welcome words of Theonoe, who knows all things truly; she says my husband is alive and sees the light of day; he is roaming here and there on countless voyages, not without practice in wandering, and he shall come here when he finds an end to his suffering. But she left one thing unsaid: if he will escape when he has come? And I refrained from asking that question clearly; I was so glad when she told me he was safe. She said that he was near this land somewhere, cast up, shipwrecked, with a few friends. Oh, when will you come? How much I long for your arrival! Ah! Who is this? I am not being ambushed by the plots of Proteus’ impious son, am I? Shall I not, like a young racehorse or a worshipper of Bacchus, reach the tomb? There is something wild about the looks of this man who is hunting me down. You there! the one trying with fearful effort to reach the base of the tomb and the pillars of burnt sacrifice, stay where you are. Why do you flee? I am amazed and speechless at the sight of your body. Women, I am being ill-treated. This man is keeping me from the tomb, and he wants to take me and give me to the king, whose wooing I was seeking to avoid. I am no thief, nor a servant of evil men. And yet the clothes you are wearing are unsightly enough. Put fear aside and stop your rapid flight. I do so, now that I have reached this spot. Who are you? Whom do I see in you, lady? But who are you? The same reason prompts us both. I never saw a closer resemblance. O gods! For the recognizing of friends is a god. Are you a woman from From You seem to me very much like Helen, lady. And you seem to me like Menelaos; I don’t know what to say. Well, you have correctly recognized a most unfortunate man. Oh, at last you have come to the arms of your wife! What do you mean by wife? Do not touch my robe. The one whom Tyndareus, my father, gave to you. O torch-bearing Hekate, send visions that are favorable! You see in me no specter of the night, attendant on the queen of phantoms. As one man, I am certainly not the husband of two women. You are the master of what other wife? The one hidden in the cave, whom I am bringing from You have no other wife but me. Can it be that I am in my right mind, but my sight is failing? Don’t you think that when you look at me you see your wife? Your body resembles hers, but the real truth robs me of this belief. Look; what more do you need? Who knows better than you? You are like her; I will not deny that at least. Who then shall teach you, if not your own eyes? It is there that I am ailing, because I have another wife. I did not go to And who fashions living bodies? The air, out of which you have a wife that the gods labored over. What god’s handiwork? You are saying things beyond hope. Hera’s, as a substitute, so that How then could you be here and in The name may be in many places, though not the body. Let me go! I have come here with enough pain. Will you leave me, and take that phantom bride away? Yes, and fare well, for your likeness to Helen. I am ruined! I found you, my husband, but I will not have you. The greatness of my troubles over there convinces me; you do not. Ah me! Who was ever more miserable than I am? Those whom I love best are leaving me, and I shall never reach the Hellenes or my own country.  What is it? Surely you are not being plundered by the foreigners? It is a miracle; what I say is of less account than what happened. Tell me; for, judging by this eagerness, you are certainly bringing something new. I say that you have suffered countless labors in vain. You are mourning over old sorrows; what is your message? Your wife has disappeared, taken up into the folds of the unseen air; she is hidden in heaven, and as she left the hallowed cave where we were keeping her, she said this: Welcome, daughter of Leda, were you here after all? I was just announcing your departure up to the hidden starry realms, not knowing that you had a winged body. I will not let you mock us like this again, for you gave your fill of trouble to your husband and his allies in This is the meaning of that; her words have turned out to be true. O longed-for day, that has given you to my arms! O Menelaos, dearest of men, the time was long, but delight is just now ours. With joy I have found my husband, friends, I have embraced my dear one, after long days of blazing light. And I have found you; but I have many questions about t; now I do not know what to begin with first. I am so happy, the hair rises on my head and my tears run down. I fling my arms around your neck, dear husband, to have my delight. O dearest sight! I have no fault to find: I have my wife, the daughter of Zeus and Leda; your brothers on their snow-white steeds blessed you, blessed you at an earlier time, while torches blazed, but the god who took you from my home is driving us on to another fortune, better than this. An evil that was good brought you together with me, your husband after a long time, but may I still benefit by my good luck. May you benefit indeed, and I join in the same prayer; for when there are two, it is not possible for one to be unhappy and the other not. My dear friends, I no longer sigh or grieve over what is past. I have my husband, for whom I have been waiting to come from You have me, and I have you; although it was hard to live through so many days, I now understand the actions of the goddess. My joy is tearful; it has more delight than sorrow. What can I say? What mortal could ever have hoped for this? I hold you to my heart, little as I ever thought to. And I hold you, whom we thought to have gone to Ida’s city and the unhappy towers of By the gods, how were you taken from my home? Ah! ah! You are setting out on a bitter beginning. Ah! ah! You are asking about a bitter tale. Speak; all gifts from the gods should be heard. I detest the story I am now to introduce. Tell it anyway. It is sweet to hear of troubles. Not to the bed of the young barbarian, on the wings of oars, on the wings of desire for lawless marriage— What god or fate tore you from your country? Ah, my husband! The son of Zeus, of Zeus, brought me to the Amazing! Who sent you there? O dreadful story! I have wept bitterly, and my eyes are wet with tears; the wife of Zeus ruined me. Hera? Why did she want to bring trouble to the two of us? Alas for my terrible fate, the baths and springs, where the goddesses brightened the  beauty from which the judgment came. Regarding the judgment, Hera made it a cause of these troubles for you? To take me away from How? Tell me. To whom Kypris had promised me. O unhappy one! Unhappy, unhappy; and so she brought me to Then she gave him a phantom instead, as I hear from you. Sorrow, sorrow to your house, mother, alas. What do you mean? My mother is no more; through shame of my disgraceful marriage she tied a noose around her neck. Alas! Is our daughter Ah, my husband! Unmarried, and without children, she mourns my fatal marriage. O Paris, who utterly destroyed my whole house, these things ruined you also, and countless bronze-clad Danaans. The god cast me out, ill-fated and accursed, from my country, from my city, and from you, when I left my home and bed—yet I did not leave them—for a shameful marriage. If indeed you should find happiness in the future, it would be a match for the past. Menelaos, give me as well a share of that joy which I understand, but not clearly. Come and take part in our talk, old man, you too. This woman is not the arbitrator of all the trouble in She is not; I was tricked by the gods and had in my arms the baneful image of a cloud. What are you saying? We suffered in vain for the sake of a cloud? It was the work of Hera, and the rivalry of the three goddesses. And the one who is truly your wife is this woman here? This is she; trust my word for that. O daughter, how intricate and hard to trace out is the nature of the god! In some way that is good, he twists everything about, now up, now down; one man suffers, and one who has not suffered comes afterwards to a bad end, having no security in his current fortune. You and your husband have had your share of trouble, you in repute, he in the heat of battle. In his eagerness, while he was eager, he got nothing; but now that he has achieved the greatest good fortune, he has it without cause. You did not, after all, bring shame upon your old father or on the twin sons of Zeus, nor did you do such things as were spoken of. Now again I renew your wedding rites and remember the blazing torch I bore, running beside the four yoked horses; and you, in the chariot as a bride, were leaving your happy home with this man here. Whoever pays no reverence to his master’s affairs, rejoicing with him and grieving with his troubles, is worthless. Although I was born a servant, let me still be numbered among honest slaves; my mind is free, if not my name. For this is better than to suffer double misery as one man: to have a worthless heart and, being a slave, to owe obedience to any other. Come, old man—often by my shield you have had your full share of trouble and hard work—now also have a share in my success, and go tell the friends I left behind the state of matters here, as you found them, and how my fortune stands; and bid them wait at the beach and watch eagerly for the struggle which I expect awaits me; and if we should be able somehow to steal this woman away from the land, tell them to keep good watch so that we may share the luck and escape, if we can, from the barbarians. It shall be done, lord. Now indeed I see how worthless the seers’ doings are, and how full of falsehood; there was no health in the blaze of sacrifice after all, or in the cry of winged birds; even to think that birds can help mankind is certainly foolish. For Calchas gave no word or sign to the army, when he saw his friends dying on behalf of a cloud, nor did Helenos; but the city was taken by storm in vain. You might say: because the god did not want them to? Then why do we consult prophets? We ought to sacrifice to the gods and ask a blessing, but leave divination alone; for this was invented otherwise, as a bait for a livelihood, and no man grows rich by sacrifices if he is idle. But sound judgment and discernment are the best of seers. My views about seers coincide exactly with this old man’s; whoever has the gods as friends would have the best prophecy at home. All right; so far all is well. But how you were saved, my poor husband, from Truly you have asked a great deal all at once. Why should I tell you about our losses in the and by telling you these evils I would suffer still, as I did when I experienced them; and so my grief would be doubled. Your answer is better than my question. Leave out the rest, and tell me only this: how long were you a weary wanderer over the surface of the sea? Besides those ten years in Alas, poor man, you have spoken of a long time; and, saved from there, you have come here to the slaughter. What do you mean? What will you say? Ah, my wife, you have ruined me. Escape from this land and flee as quickly as possible. The man who lives in this house will kill you. What have I done to deserve such a fate? You have come unexpectedly to hinder my marriage. What! Does someone plan to marry my wife? And to act in violence against me, which I have endured. Does he have private power, or is he the ruler of the country? He is the lord of this land, the son of Proteus. This is that riddle I heard from the servant. Which one of the barbarian’s gates were you standing beside? This one, from which I was being driven away like a beggar. You were surely not begging for food, were you? How unhappy I am! That was the deed, though it did not have that name. Then you know everything, it seems, about my marriage. I do. But if you have escaped his bed—that I do not know. Know that I have saved myself untouched for you. What could persuade me of this? If true, your words are sweet. Do you see my wretched sanctuary at this tomb? I see a miserable bed of straw, but what do you have to do with it? Here, as a suppliant, I am asking for an escape from his bed. For want of an altar, or because it is the barbarians’ way? This was as good a protection to me as the temples of the gods. Then it’s not possible for me to take you home by ship? A sword is waiting for you, rather than my bed. So I would be the most wretched of mortals. Do not feel shame now, but escape from this land. Leaving you behind? I ravaged Yes, for that is better than that our union should cause your death. Oh! these are coward’s words, unworthy of those days at You could not kill the tyrant, your possible intention. Does he then have a body that cannot be wounded by a sword? You will hear. But to undertake impossibilities is no mark of wisdom. And so I am to offer my hands to be bound, in silence? You are in a dilemma; we need some contrivance. Yes, for it is sweeter to die in action than by not acting. There is one hope, and only one, for our safety. Are we to buy it, or dare it, or win it with words? If the tyrant were not to learn of your arrival. Will any one tell him about me? He will certainly not know who I am. He has within an ally equal to the gods. A voice that has settled in the inmost parts of his house? No, but his sister; she is called Theonoe. The name is prophetic; tell me what she does. She knows everything, and she will tell her brother that you are here. We must die; for I cannot escape her notice. Perhaps we might persuade her by supplication— To do what? What hope are you leading me to? Not to tell her brother that you are here in this land. If we persuade her, could we get away from this country? Easily, in common with her; but secretly we could not. The task is yours; it is suitable for women to deal with women. Be sure that I will clasp her knees. Well, then, what if she rejects our proposals? You will die. And I, the unhappy one, will be married by force. You would be a traitor; that force of yours is all an excuse. But I have sworn a sacred oath by your life— What do you mean? To die? And never to take his bed in exchange for mine? Yes, by the same sword; I will lie at your side. Then on these conditions touch my right hand. I touch it, swearing that I will leave the light of day if you die. And I will end my life if I lose you. How then shall we die so as to insure our reputation for this? I will kill you on the tomb’s surface, and then kill myself. But first I will fight a great contest for your bed. Let anyone who wishes come near! For I will not disgrace my Trojan fame, nor, on my return to shall I not resolve to die for my wife? Most certainly; for if the gods are wise, they lightly bury in the earth a brave man who has been killed by his enemies, while cowards they cast up out of the earth onto a harsh rock. O gods, may the race of Tantalos be fortunate at last, and may it be set free from evils! Ah, I am unhappy, for so is my fate! Menelaos, we are destroyed. The prophetess Theonoe is coming out of the house; it resounds as the bolts are unfastened. Try to escape! But what is the use of trying? For whether she is absent or present she knows of your arrival here. Oh, I am lost, unfortunate! Saved from Please lead the way with blazing torches, and purify, according to the sacred law, the inmost corners of the air, so I may receive the pure breath of heaven; and you in turn, if someone has harmed the path by treading with unholy foot, submit it to the cleansing fire, and strike the torch in front of me, so that I may pass through. And when you have paid back to the gods my customary observance, take the household flame within. Helen, what about my prophecy—how is it? This man, your husband Menelaos, has openly arrived, robbed of his ships and of your counterfeit. O unhappy man! What troubles you have escaped to come here; nor do you know whether you are to return home or to stay here. For there will be strife among the gods, and a solemn assembly held by Zeus on your account this very day. Hera, who was hostile to you before, is now friendly and wants to bring you safely home, with this woman, so that so that she may not be convicted, or seem to have bought the prize of beauty by a marriage that was profitless as regards Helen. Now the decision rests with me, whether to ruin you, as Kypris wishes, by telling my brother of your presence here, or to save your life by taking Hera’s side, keeping my brother in the dark, for his orders are for me to tell him, whenever you happen to come to this land. One of you, go show my brother this man is here, so that I may secure my position. Maiden, I fall at your knees as a suppliant, and seat myself in this sad posture on behalf of myself and of this man; I am on the point of seeing him slain, after I have found him with such difficulty. Please do not tell your brother that my husband has returned to my loving arms, but save us, I beseech you; do not forsake the piety that was once yours for your brother’s sake, buying favors that are wicked and unjust. For the god hates violence, and commands everyone to have their possessions without robbery. At a critical time, but unhappily for me, Hermes gave me to your father to keep safe for my husband, this man who is here and wishes to have me back. But how could he recover me if he is dead? How could your father ever restore the living to the dead? Now examine the will of the god and of your father; would the deity and your dead father be willing to give back again their neighbor’s goods, or would they not? I think they would. It is not, therefore, right that you should attach more importance to a thoughtless brother more than a good father. If you, who are a prophet and believe in divine affairs, ruin the lawful intention of your father and gratify your lawless brother, it is disgraceful that you should have full knowledge of divine matters, both what is and what will be, and yet not know what is right. Save me, the unhappy one, enveloped in these troubles, and give me this addition to my fate; for there is no mortal who does not hate Helen; I am famous throughout they will hear and see how they were ruined by the wiles of gods, while I was no traitor to my friends after all; and so they will lead me back to virtue again, and I shall betroth my daughter, whom no man now will marry; and, leaving this bitter beggar’s life here, shall enjoy the goods that are in my home. And if this man were dead and slaughtered on a funeral pyre, I would be cherishing his memory with tears far away; but shall I be robbed of him when he is now alive and safe? Ah! not that, maiden, I beseech you: grant me this favor, and imitate the character of a just father; for this is the fairest glory for children, when the child of a good father resembles its parents in character. The arguments here proposed are worthy of pity, and so are you. But I am anxious to hear what Menelaos will say to save his life. I could not endure to fall at your knees, or wet my eyes with tears; for if I were cowardly, I would greatly dishonor And yet they say that it is fitting for a noble man to let tears fall from his eyes in misfortune. But I will not choose this honorable course, if it is honorable, in preference to bravery. But, if you think it right to save a stranger seeking justly to recover his wife, then restore her and save us in addition; if not, I would be wretched, not now for the first time but as often before, and you will seem to be an evil woman. What I consider honest and worthy of me, and what will touch your heart most closely, these things I will say at the tomb of your father, with regret for his loss. Old man, dwelling in this tomb of stone, give her back, I demand of you my wife, whom Zeus sent here for you to keep for me. I know you will never restore her to me yourself, for you are dead; but this woman here will not think it right that her father, invoked from below, once so glorious, should bear a tarnished name; for she is the one in authority now. You, too, Hades of the world below, I call as an ally; you who have received so many bodies slain by my sword for Helen’s sake, you have your payment; either restore them to life again now, or compel this woman to show herself better than her pious father, and give me back my wife. But if you will rob me of her, I will tell you what she omitted in her speech. So that you may know, maiden, I am bound by an oath, first to go into battle with your brother; he or I must die; the matter is simple. If he refuses to meet me face to face, but hunts us down, two suppliants at the tomb, by starvation, I am resolved to kill this woman, and then to plunge this two-edged sword through my heart, on the surface of the tomb, so that streams of blood may run down the grave; we will lie, two corpses side by side upon this polished slab, a deathless grief to you, and a reproach to your father. Your brother will never marry this woman, nor will any other; but I will carry her off, if not to my house, at any rate to death. Why do I say this? If I turned to women’s ways with tears, rather than being active, I would be pitied more. Kill me, if it seems good to you; you will not kill those who are without fame; but it is better to yield to what I say, so that you may act with justice, and I recover my wife. You must judge these arguments, maiden. Decide in such a way as to please all. My nature and my inclination lean towards piety; and I respect myself, and I would not defile my father’s fame, or gratify my brother at the cost of seeming infamous. There is a great temple of justice in my nature; and having this heritage from Nereus, I will try to keep it, Menelaos. Since Hera wishes to serve you, I will cast my vote on her side. May Kypris be gracious to me; but she has had nothing to do with me, and I will try to remain a virgin always. As for your reproaches against my father at this tomb, I have the same words to say. I would be doing wrong if I do not give her back; for that man, if he were alive, would have given her back for you to have, and you to her. For truly there is retribution for these things, both among the dead and among all men living. The mind of the dead does not live, yet it has eternal thought as it falls into eternal ether. So as not to give advice at length, I will be silent as to what you have entreated, and I will never aid my brother’s folly with my counsel. For I am doing him a service, though he does not think it, if I turn him from his godless life to holiness. You yourselves devise some course of action; I will stand out of your way by my silence. Begin with the gods, and beg Kypris to allow you to return to your country, and Hera that her intention to save you and your husband may remain the same. And you, my own dead father, never, as far as I have strength, shall you be called impious instead of pious. No one born lawless ever prospered, but in a lawful cause there is hope of safety. Menelaos, as far as the maiden is concerned, we are safe. For the rest, you must contribute your advice and frame a device to save ourselves. Then listen; you have been in the house for a long time and are intimate with the king’s servants. What do you mean by that? You are offering hope, as if you were really about to do something useful for both of us. Could you persuade someone in charge of the wagons and horses to give us a chariot? I might; but how will we escape, in our ignorance of the country and the barbarian land? You are right; a dilemma. Well, what if I were to hide in the house and kill the king with this two-edged sword? His sister would never be silent or allow you to intend her own brother’s death. Nor indeed is there a ship in which we might safely escape; for the sea holds the one we had. Listen to me, if even a woman can say something wise. Are you willing to be called dead in word, though you are not dead? It is a bad omen; but if I profit by it, I am ready to be called dead in word, though I am not dead. And truly I would mourn you, as women do, with hair cut short and laments before this impious man. What saving remedy does this have for us two? There is a flavor of deception in your scheme. I will beg the tyrant of this country for permission to bury you in an empty tomb, as if you had really died at sea. Soppose he allows it; then how shall we escape with no ship, when we have buried my body in the empty tomb? I will urge him to give me a vessel, from which I shall have the offerings from your tomb let down into the sea’s embrace. You have spoken well, except for one thing: if he commands you to set up a tomb on the dry land, your pretext comes to nothing. But I will say it is not the custom in You are setting this right, too; then I will sail with you, and help let down the funeral offerings, in the same ship. You must above all be at hand, with your sailors who escaped from the wreck. Be sure that if I have a ship at anchor, they will be posted, man beside man, each with his sword. You must direct everything; only let there be winds in our sails to guide us, and a speedy ship. It will be so; for the deities will bring my troubles to an end. But from whom will you say that you heard I was dead? From you; allege that you were the only one to escape death, when you were sailing with the son of Atreus, and that you saw him dead. It is true that these rags thrown around my body will bear witness with me as to the shipwreck. They have come at the right time, although then they seemed an ill-timed loss. Perhaps that misery may turn to good fortune. Should I to enter the house with you, or am I to sit quietly here at this tomb? Stay here; for if he does something harsh to you, this tomb and your sword would protect you. But I will go into the house, cut off my hair, exchange my white robe for a dark one, and tear my cheek with nails that make the flesh bloody. For the contest is a great one, and I see two turns of the scale: either I must die if I am detected in my plot, or else come home and save you as well. Lady Hera, you who lie in the bed of Zeus, grant relief from their labors to two pitiable creatures; we beg you, casting our arms straight towards heaven, where you have your home in an embroidery of stars. And you, who won the prize of beauty at the price of my marriage, Kypris, daughter of Dione, do not destroy me utterly. You have maltreated me enough before now, handing over my name, though not my body, to barbarians. Let me die, if you want to kill me, in my native land. Why are you so insatiable for mischief, practising arts of love, deceits, and treacherous schemes, and magic spells that bring bloodshed on families? If you were only moderate, in other ways you are by nature the sweetest of gods for men; I don’t deny it. Let me call on you, beneath leafy haunts, sitting in your place of song, you, the most sweetly singing bird, tearful nightingale, oh, come, trilling through your tawny throat, to aid me in my lament, as I sing the piteous woes of Helen and the tearful fate of Trojan women under the Achaeans’ spears; when he sped over the surging plains with foreign oar, when he came, came bringing to Priam’s race from you, Helen, his unhappy bride— Many of the Achaeans have breathed out their last amid the spears and hurling stones and have gone to unhappy Hades; their wives have cut off their hair in sorrow, and their homes are left without a bride; an Achaean man, who had only a single ship, lit a blazing beacon on sea-girt and the sea-shores of the with the Danaans, Hera’s holy phantom. What is god, or what is not god, or what is in between— what mortal says he has found it by searching the farthest limit, when he sees divine affairs leaping here and there again and back, in contradictory and unexpected chances? You, Helen, are the daughter of Zeus; for a winged father begot you in but the word of the gods I have found true. You are fools, who try to win a reputation for virtue through war and marshalled lines of spears, senselessly putting an end to mortal troubles; for if a bloody quarrel is to decide it, strife will never leave off in the towns of men; by it they won as their lot bed-chambers of Priam’s earth, when they could have set right by discussion the strife over you, O Helen. And now they are below in Hades’ keeping, and fire has darted onto the walls like the bolt of Zeus, and you are bringing woe on woe . . . . Greetings, tomb of my father! For I buried you, Proteus, in the passageway so that I could address you; and always as I leave and enter the house, I, your son Theoklymenos, call on you, father. You servants, take the hounds and hunting nets into the palace. I have rebuked myself many times; for do we not punish evil men with death? And now I have heard that some Hellene has come openly to the land, without the guards’ notice, either as a spy or thievishly hunting after Helen; he will die if only I can catch him. Ah! But it seems I have found everything in ruins; for the daughter of Tyndareus has deserted her seat at the tomb and has been carried away from the land. Ho there! undo the bars; loose the horses from their stalls, servants, and bring out my chariot, so that the wife whom I long for may not be carried away from this land without my notice, for want of effort. Wait! for I see that the one I am pursuing is still in the house, and has not fled. You there, why have you put black robes instead of white on your body, and cut the hair from your noble head with a sword, and why do you drench your cheeks with pale tears, lamenting? Do you mourn, persuaded by dreams in the night, or have you broken your heart with grief because you heard some voice within? My lord—for now I give you that name—I am destroyed; everything of mine is gone and I am nothing. In what misfortune are  you plunged? What has happened? Menelaos—alas, how shall I say it?—is dead, my husband. I do not rejoice at your words, but it is good fortune for me. How do you know? Did Theonoe tell you this? Both she, and one who was there when he perished. Someone has come who announces this for certain? Someone has come; and may he go where I want him to go! Who is it? Where is he? so that I may learn this more clearly. That one, who is sitting crouched at this tomb. Apollo! He certainly has unattractive clothing. Alas! I think my husband is in the same situation also. What is this man’s country, and where did he come from, to land here? He is a Hellene, one of the Achaeans who saiIed with my husband. What kind of death does he say Menelaos died? The most piteous, in the watery waves at sea. On what part of the barbarous ocean was he sailing? He was cast up on the harborless rocks of How did this man not perish if he was sailing with him? There are times when common men have more luck than their betters. Where did he leave the wreckage of his ship before coming here? Where ruin may come upon it— but not on Menelaos! He is already ruined. In what ship did this man come? Sailors happened to meet him and took him up, as he says. Where then is that mischievous creature that was sent to You mean the cloud image? It has gone into the air. O Priam, and Trojan lands, how you have perished in vain! I too have shared misfortunes with Priam’s race. Did he leave your husband unburied, or did he hide him in the earth? He is unburied; I am so unhappy in my troubles! It is for this that you have cut your locks of golden hair? Yes, for he is dear to me, whoever he is, being here. She rightly weeps for this misfortune.  .  . It is certainly easy to escape your sister’s notice! No, indeed. Well, what now? Will you continue to live at this tomb? Why do you jeer at me? Won’t you let the dead man be? No, for you are loyal to your husband and avoid me. No longer; begin my wedding now. It has come after a long time, but still I commend you for it. Do you know what you should do? Let us forget what is past. On what terms? One good turn deserves another. Let us make a truce; be reconciled to me. I relinquish my quarrel with you; may it go away on wings. Now by your knees, since you are indeed a friend— What thing do you hunt after, that you stretch out a suppliant hand to me? I wish to bury my dead husband. What? Is there a tomb for the absent? Or will you bury a shadow? It is customary among the Hellenes, whenever someone dies at sea— To do what? The race of Pelops is certainly clever in such matters. To carry out the funeral rites in empty woven robes. Hold the funeral; set up the tomb wherever you wish. We do not give burial like this to sailors who have perished. How then? I know nothing of the customs in We take out of harbor to the sea all that is the dead man’s due. Then what am I to give you for the dead man? This man knows, but I have no experience, as I was fortunate before. Stranger, you have brought welcome news. Not for me, certainly, nor for the dead man. How do you bury those who have died at sea? Each according to his means. As far as wealth goes, say what you want, for her sake. There must be a blood-offering first to the dead. Blood of what? Explain it to me, and I will obey. You decide that yourself; whatever you give will suffice. Among barbarians it is customary to sacrifice a horse or a bull. If you make a gift, take care to give nothing mean. I have no lack of such in my rich herds. Next, a couch empty of the body is decked and carried in procession. It wall be done; what else is it customary to add? Bronze arms; for war was his delight. These will be worthy of the race of Pelops, and these we will give. And for the rest, all the lovely offspring that the earth bears. How then? In what way do you let them fall into the waves? A ship must be ready, and rowers. How far from the shore does the ship put out? So far that the foam in her wake can scarcely be seen from the land. But why? Why does So that the waves may not wash pollution back ashore. A swift Phoenician ship will be there. That would be well done, and pleasing to Menelaos, too. Can you not perform these rites well enough without Helen? This task belongs to mother, or wife, or children. According to you, the work of burying her husband belongs to her. Yes indeed; piety demands that the dead be not robbed of their due. Let her go; it is in my interest to foster piety in a wife. Go inside and choose adornment for the dead; I will not send you away from the land empty-handed either, since you have done her a favor. As you have brought me good news, you will receive clothing instead of going in rags, and food, so that you may reach your country, since now I see you doing very badly indeed. As for you, poor lady, do not wear yourself out in a hopeless case; Menelaos has met his doom, and your dead husband could not return to life. This is your duty, young woman; you must be content with the husband at your side, and let go the one that no longer exists; for this is best for you, according to what has happened. And if I come to I will; my husband will never find fault with me; you yourself will be at hand to know it. Now go inside, unhappy man, and find the bath, and change your clothes. I will show my kindness to you without delay. For you will perform the due services with more kindly feeling for my dearest Menelaos, if you get from me what you ought to have. Once with swift foot the mountain mother of the gods rushed through the wooded glen, and the river’s streams and the deep-thundering sea wave, yearning for her lost daughter, whose name may not be spoken. The loudly rattling castanets cried out a shrill sound, when they, swift-footed as whirlwinds, followed the goddess on her chariot yoked to wild creatures, after the girl that was snatched away from the circling chorus of maidens— here Artemis with her bow, and there the grim-eyed goddess, in full armor, with her spear. But Zeus, who sees clearly from his throne in heaven, brought to pass another destiny. When the mother ceased from her wild wandering toil, searching for the treacherous rape of her daughter, she crossed the snow-capped heights of the nymphs of and in sorrow cast herself down in the rocky woods deep in snow; and, by not making fruitful with crops the barren fields of the earth for mortals, she destroyed the human race. She would not send forth the rich nourishment of leafy tendrils for the herds, and life was leaving the cities. No sacrifice was offered to the gods, and on the altars were no cakes to burn; she made the dew-fed springs of clear water cease flowing, the avenger in sorrow for her child. When she made an end to banquets for gods and the race of men, Zeus spoke out, appeasing the Mother’s gloomy wrath: and received in her hand the deep-toned flute, pleased with its loud note. You made burnt offerings that were neither right nor holy, in the chambers of the gods, and you have incurred the wrath of the great mother, child, by not honoring her sacrifices. Oh! Great is the power of dappled fawn-skin robes, and green ivy that crowns a sacred thyrsos, the whirling beat of the tambourine circling in the air, hair streaming wildly for the revelry of Bromios, and the night-long festivals of the goddess. . . . You gloried in your beauty alone. My friends, all goes well for us inside; for the daughter of Proteus, who aids us in our theft, has told her brother nothing when questioned as to my husband’s coming; for my sake she said that he was not alive, but dead and buried. . . . My husband has snatched up by chance fine things indeed; for he is carrying away the armor he was intending to let fall into the sea, putting his noble arm through the shield-strap and holding a spear in his right hand, on pretence of joining in the service to the dead. He has equipped his body with weapons conveniently for the battle, in order to to set up the trophies of countless barbarians, whenever we embark on the oared ship. I adorned him with robes in place of his shipwrecked garments, and I washed him, a long-delayed bath in water from the stream. But I must be silent, for the man is coming from the house who thinks he holds my marriage ready in his hands; and I claim your goodwill and strict silence, so that, when we have saved ourselves, we may be able some day to save you also. Advance in order, servants, as the stranger directed, bearing the funeral gifts for the sea. But you, Helen, if you will agree with my words, be persuaded and stay here; for you will do your husband equal service whether you are present or not. For I am afraid that some sudden passion should persuade you to throw your body into the swelling waves, stricken by love for your former husband; you are grieving for him too much, although he is lost. O my new husband, I must honor my first marriage-bed and the one whose company I shared as a bride; for I could even die with my husband, I loved him so much. But how could he thank me, if I were to share death with him? Let me go and pay funeral rites to the dead in person. May the gods give to you the things I wish and also to this stranger here, for his assistance! And you will have in me such a wife at home as you ought to have, since you are doing a good service to Menelaos and to me; for surely these events are leading to some good fortune. But now appoint someone to give us a ship in which to carry these gifts, so that I may have your kindness in full.  This man who is ordering the funeral will be in command of the ship, won’t he? Most certainly; my sailors must obey him. Repeat the order, so that they may clearly understand you. I repeat the order, and a third time too, if you wish it. May you have benefit from it—and I from my plans! Do not ruin your skin with too much weeping now. This day will show my gratitude to you. The state of the dead is nothingness; toil for them is vain. There is something of what I say both there and here. You will not find in me a husband at all inferior to Menelaos. You are not at fault in any way; good luck is all I need. That is in your power, if you show kindness to me. This is not a lesson I shall have to learn now, to love my friends. Would you like me to send out the equipment in person, working together with you? Not at all! Do not become a slave to your slaves, lord. Come then! I have no concern with the customs of the race of Pelops. My house is pure; for Menelaos did not die here. Let someone go and tell my chieftans to bring marriage-offerings to my house; the whole earth must ring with joyful wedding-songs in celebration of my wedding with Helen, so that it may be envied. You, stranger, go and give to the sea’s embrace these offerings to this woman’s husband, who was once alive; and then hurry back home with my wife, so that after sharing with me her marriage-feast, you may set out for home or remain here in happiness. O Zeus, called father and god of wisdom, look on us and alter our woes! As we drag our fortunes to the rocky hill, make haste to join with us; if you touch us with your finger-tip only, we shall reach our longed-for goal. There has been enough distress in what we have suffered before. I have invoked you, gods, with many names, good and painful; I am not bound to be unfortunate forever, but to advance in a straight course. If you grant me one favor, you will make me fortunate hereafter. O swift Phoenician ship of of dolphins, when the sea is clear of breezes and Ocean’s gray-green daughter, spirit of calm, says these words: Perhaps you may find the daughters of Leukippos beside the swell of the river or before the temple of Pallas, when at last you join in the dances or the revels of Hyakinthos in night-long joy—Hyakinthos, whom Phoebus killed with the round discus, contesting for the farthest throw—a day of the sacrifice of oxen in the Lakonian land; the son of Zeus declared that his race would be honored; and you may find the girl whom you left at home, Oh, that we had wings to cleave the air, where the birds of leaving the winter rain, obedient to the piping of their veteran leader, who raises his exultant cry as he wings his way over unmoistened and crop-bearing plains of the earth. O you winged long-necked comrades of the racing clouds, go on beneath the Pleiades in their central station and Orion of the night; deliver the message, as you settle on Eurotas’ banks, that Menelaos has sacked the city of May you come at last, speeding over your horses’ path through the sky, sons of Tyndareus, under the whirling of the radiant stars; you who dwell in heaven, Helen’s rescuers, go over the gray-green swell and the dark gray surge of sea-waves, sending the sailors favoring breezes from Zeus; and cast away from your sister her ill-fame from marriage with a barbarian, the punishment she received from the contest on Ida; but she never went to the land of  What is it? Go to work on the courtship of another woman; for Helen has left the country. Carried up on wings, or treading on the earth? Menelaos has taken her off as plunder, out of the land; he was the one that came with the news of his own death. O dreadful story! What ship carried her off from this land? Your story is unbelievable. The very one that you gave to the stranger; and he has gone with your sailors, so that you may know everything in brief. How? I am eager to know; for I never expected that a single hand could excel over so many sailors, with whom you were sent. When the daughter of Zeus had left this royal house and started for the sea, delicately picking her way, she most cleverly began to mourn her husband, though he was close at hand and not dead. When we reached the enclosure of your dockyards, we began to launch the Sidonian ship on her first voyage, with her fifty benches and full measure of rowers. Task gave way to task: one set up the mast, another set up the oars . . . and the rudders were lowered by their cross-bars. And during this labor, men of Hellas who had been fellow-voyagers with Menelaos were watching us, it seems, and they drew near to the beach, clad in the rags of shipwrecked men, handsome, but rough to look upon. And the son of Atreus, when he saw them approach, spoke to them, craftily introducing the reason for his mourning: and said to each other that there would be a crowd of those additional passengers; but still we remained silent, out of respect for your orders; for by bidding the stranger command the vessel, you threw everything into confusion. Well, we easily put the other victims on the ship, for they were light; but the bull did not want to go forward along the plank, but kept bellowing loudly, rolling his eyes around; and, arching his back and peering along his horns, he prevented us from touching him. But Helen’s husband called out: Then they came at his summons, and caught up the bull and carried him on to the deck. And Menelaos stroked the horse on neck and brow, coaxing it to go aboard. Finally, when the ship was fully loaded, Helen climbed up the ladder with elegant step, and took her seat in the middle of the rowers’ benches, and he was near by, Menelaos who was called dead. The rest, equally divided on the right and left sides of the ship, sat down, each beside his man, with swords concealed beneath their cloaks, and the waves were filled with shouting as we heard the voice of the boatswain. Now when we had put out from land, neither very far nor very near, the helmsman asked, They all leapt upright, some with oars in their hands, others with swords; and the ship ran with blood. Helen cheered them on from the stern: fall, some stood upright, you would have seen others lying dead. But Menelaos, in full armor, wherever he spied that his comrades were suffering, would go there, sword in hand; and so we dived from the ship, and he cleared the benches of your rowers. Then going to the helmsman he told him to sail a straight course to They are gone from here. But I escaped death and let myself down by the anchor into the sea; and just as I was worn out, some fisherman took me up, and put me out on land, to bring you this report. Nothing is more useful to mankind than a prudent distrust. I never would have believed that Menelaos could have eluded both us and you, O king, the way he did on his arrival. Caught by a woman’s tricks, unhappy that I am! My bride has escaped me. If the ship could have been pursued and overtaken, I would have made an effort to catch the strangers at once; but now I will avenge myself upon my treacherous sister, for she saw Menelaos in my house and did not tell me. Therefore she will never deceive another man by her oracles. You, there! Where are you rushing off to, my lord? to what bloody deed? Where justice calls me. Get out of my way! I will not let go of your robe, for you are striving after great wickedness. Will you rule over your master, although you are a slave? Yes, for I am in my right mind. Not in my opinion, if you will not let me— No, I will not let you! Let me kill my most wicked sister— No, she is most pious. Who betrayed me— It was a noble betrayal, correctly done. When she gave my bride to another. To the one who had a better right. Who has rights over my property? The one who received her from her father. But fortune gave her to me. And necessity took her away. It is not for you to judge my affairs. Yes, if my counsel is better. So I am your subject, not your ruler. Subject to do right, not wrong. It seems you desire to be killed. Kill me; you will not kill your sister with my consent, but me instead; to die for their masters is the most glorious act for noble slaves. Restrain the anger that is wrongly carrying you away, Theoklymenos, king of this land. We, the twin sons of Zeus, are calling you; Leda once gave birth to us, with Helen, who has fled from your home. For you are angry about a marriage that is not destined for you; and your sister Theonoe, daughter of a Nereid goddess, does not wrong you when she honors the word of the gods and her father’s just commands. For it was ordained that Helen should live in your house up to the present time; but no longer, since and come home and live with her husband. But hold your black sword away from your sister, and believe that she is acting with discretion in this matter. Long ago, before this, we would have saved our sister, seeing that Zeus has made us gods; but we are weaker than fate and also than the gods, who decreed these things to happen in this way. This is my bidding to you, while I say to my sister: You sons of Leda and Zeus, I will let go my former quarrel over your sister; and mine I shall no longer try to kill. Let Helen go home, if the gods think it right. Know that you are born from the same blood as a sister who is the best and also most self-controlled; may you fare well, for the sake of Helen’s most noble mind, a quality not to be found in many women. Many are the forms of divinities, and many things the gods bring to pass unhoped for. And what was expected has not been fulfilled; for what was not expected, a god finds a way. Such was the result of this action.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I hold this true, and long have held: Nature hath made one man upright for his neighbours’ good, while another hath a disposition wholly given over to gain, useless alike to the state and difficult to have dealings with, but for himself the best of men; and this I know, not from mere hearsay. I, for instance, from pure regard and reverence for my kith and kin, though I might have lived at peace in Argos, alone of all my race shared with Heracles his labours, while he was yet with us, and now that he dwells in heaven, I keep these his children safe beneath my wing, though myself I need protection. For when their father passed from earth away, Eurystheus would first of all have slain us, but we escaped. And though our home is lost, our life was saved. But in exile we wander from city to city, ever forced to roam. For, added to our former wrongs, Eurystheus thought it fit to put this further outrage upon us: wheresoe’er he heard that we were settling, thither would he send heralds demanding our surrender and driving us from thence, holding bow to his superior might and drive us from their land. And I share the exile of these children, and help them bear their evil lot by my sympathy, loth to betray them, lest someone two sons of Theseus dwell upon these plains, the lot of their inheritance, scions of Pandion’s stock, related to these children; this the reason we have come on this our way to the borders of glorious Athens. To lead the flight two aged guides are we; my care is centred on these boys, while she, I mean Alcmena, clasps her son’s daughter in her arms, and bears her for safety within this shrine, for we shrink from letting tender maidens Now Hyllus and the elder of his brethren are seeking some place for us to find a refuge, if we are driven by force from this land. O children, children, come hither! hold unto my robe; for lo! I see a herald coming towards us from Eurystheus, by whom we are persecuted, wanderers excluded from every land. A curse on thee and him that sent thee, hateful wretch! for that same tongue of thine hath oft announced its master’s evil hests to these children’s noble sire as well. Doubtless thy folly lets thee think this is a good position to have taken up, and that thou art come to a city that will help thee. No ! there is none that will prefer thy feeble arm to the might of Eurystheus. Begone! why take this trouble? Thou must arise and go to Argos, where awaits thee death by stoning. Not so, for the god’s altar will protect me, and this land of freedom, wherein we have set foot. Wilt give me the trouble of laying hands on thee? By force at least shalt thou never drag these children hence. That shalt thou soon learn; it seems thou wert a poor prophet, after all, in this. This shall never happen while I live. Begone! for I will take them hence, for all thy refusals, for I hold Help, ye who long nave had your home in Athens! we suppliants at Zeus’ altar in your market-place are being haled by force away, our sacred wreaths defiled, shame to your city, to the gods dishonour. Hark, hark! What cry is this that rises near the altar? At once explain the nature of the trouble. See this aged frame hurled in its feebleness upon the ground! Woe is me! Who threw thee down thus pitiably? Behold the man who flouts your gods, kind sirs, and tries by force to drag me from my seat before the altar of Zeus. From what land, old stranger, art thou come to this confederate state of four cities? or have ye left Euboea’s cliffs, and, with the oar that sweeps the sea, put in here from across the firth? Sirs, no island life I lead, but from Mycenae to thy land I come. What do they call thee, aged sir, those folk in Mycenae? Maybe ye have heard of Iolaus, the comrade of Heracles, for he was not unknown to fame. Yea, I have heard of him in bygone days; but tell me, whose are the tender boys thou bearest in thine arms? These, sirs, are the sons of Heracles, come as suppliants to you and your city. What is their quest? Are they anxious, tell me, to obtain an audience of the state? That so they may escape surrender, nor be tom with violence from thy altars, and brought to Argos. Nay, this will nowise satisfy thy masters, who o’er thee have a right, and so have tracked thee hither. Stranger, ’tis but right we should reverence the gods’ suppliants, suffering none with violent hand to make them Do thou then drive these subjects of Eurystheus forth, and this hand of mine shall abstain from violence. ’Twere impious for the state to neglect the suppliant stranger’s prayer. Yet ’tis well to keep clear of troubles, by adopting that counsel, which is the wiser. Thou then, shouldst have told the monarch of this land thy errand before being so bold, out of regard to his country’s freedom, instead of trying to drag strangers by force from the altars of the gods. Who is monarch of this land and state? Demophon, son of gallant Theseus. Surely it were most to the purpose to discuss this matter somewhat with him; all else has been said in vain. Lo! here he comes in person, in hot haste, and Acamas his brother, to hear what thou hast to say. Since thou for all thy years hast outstripped younger men in coming to the rescue to this altar of Zeus, do thou tell me what hath chanced to bring this crowd together. There sit the sons of Heracles as suppliants, having wreathed the altar, as thou seest, O king, and with them is Iolaus, trusty comrade of their sire. Why should this event have called for cries of pain?  Hellenic dress and fashion in his robes doth he no doubt adopt, but deeds like these betray the barbarian. Thou, sirrah, tell me straight the country whence thou earnest thither. An Argive I; since that thou seek’st to know. Who sent me, and the object of my coming, will I freely tell. Eurystheus, king of Mycenae, sends me hither to fetch these back; and I have come, sir stranger, with just grounds in plenty, alike for speech or action. An Argive myself, Argives I come to fetch, taking with me these runaways from my native city, on whom the doom of death was passed by our laws there; and we have a right, since we rule our city independently, to ratify its sentences. And though they have come as suppliants to the altars of numerous others, we have taken our stand on these same arguments, and no one has ventured to bring upon himself evils of his own getting. But they have come hither, either because they perceived some folly in thee, or, in their perplexity, staking all on one risky throw to win or lose; for surely they do not suppose that thou, if so thou hast thy senses still, and only thou, in all the breadth of Hellas they have traversed, wilt pity their foolish troubles. Come now, put argument against argument: what will be thy gain, suppose thou admit them to thy land, or let us take them hence? From us these benefits are thine to win: this city can secure as friends Argos, with its far-reaching arm, and Eurystheus’ might complete; whilst if thou lend an ear to their piteous pleading and grow soft, the matter must result in trial of arms; for be sure we shall not yield this struggle without appealing to the sword. What pretext wilt thou urge? Of what will they have fallen whom thou buriest? Surely thou wilt get an evil name from the citizens, if for the sake of an old man with one foot in the grave, a mere shadow I may say, and for these children, thou wilt plunge into troublous waters. The best and yet this falls far short of the present need; for these would be but a poor match for Argives even when fully armed and in their prime, if haply that raises thy spirits; moreover, the time ’twixt now and then is long, wherein ye may be blotted out. Nay, hearken to me; give me naught, but let me take mine own, and so gain Mycenae; but forbear to act now, as is your Athenian way, and take the weaker side, when it is in thy power to choose the stronger as thy friends. Who can decide a cause or ascertain its merits, till from both sides he clearly learn what they would say? O king, in thy land I start with this advantage, the right to hear and speak in turn, and none, ere that, will drive me hence as elsewhere they would. ’Twixt us and him is naught in common, for we no longer have aught to do with Argos since that decree was passed, but we are exiles from our native land; how then can he justly drag us back as subjects of Mycenae, Or do ye claim that every exile from Argos is exiled from the bounds of Hellas? Not but boasting of the might of Argos in the very words thou now art using, didst drive the suppliants from their station at the altar. If this shall be, and they thy words approve, why then I trow this is no more Athens, the home of freedom. Nay, but I know the temper and nature of these citizens; they would rather die, for honour ranks before mere life with men of worth. Enough of Athens! for excessive praise is apt to breed disgust; and oft ere now I have myself felt vexed at praise that knows no bounds. But to thee, as ruler of this land, I fain would show the reason why thou art bound to save these children. Pittheus was the son of Pelops; from him sprung Aethra, and from her Theseus thy sire was born. And now will I trace back these children’s lineage for thee. Heracles was son of Zeus and Alcmena; Alcmena sprang from Pelops’ daughter; therefore thy father and their father would be the sons of first cousins. Thus then art thou to them related, O Demophon, but thy just debt to them beyond the ties of kinship do I now declare to thee; for I assert, in days gone by, I was with Theseus on the ship, as their father’s squire, when they went to fetch that girdle fraught with death; yea, and from Hades’ murky dungeons did Heracles bring thy father up; as all Hellas doth attest. kith and kin of thine, be haled away by force. For pity’s be to them father, brother, lord; for better each and all of these than to fall beneath the Argives’ hand. O king, I pity them, hearing their sad lot Now more than ever do I see noble birth o’ercome by fortune; for these, though sprung from a noble sire, are suffering what they ne’er deserved. Three aspects of the case constrain me, Iolaus, not to spurn the guests thou bringest; first and foremost, there is Zeus, at whose altar thou art seated with these tender children gathered round thee; next come ties of kin, and the debt I owe to treat them kindly for their father’s sake; and last, mine honour, which before all I must regard; for if I permit this altar to be violently despoiled by stranger hands, men will think the land I inhabit is free no more, and that through fear Get thee Not even if I have right upon my side and prove my case? How can it be right to drag the suppliant away by force? Well, Tis harm to me, if I let them be haled away by thee. Banish them thyself, and then will I take them from elsewhere. Nature made thee a fool, to think thou knowest better than the god. It seems then evildoers are to find a refuge here. A temple of the gods is an asylum open to the world. Maybe they will not take this view in Mycensa. What! am I not lord of this domain? So long as thou injure not the Argives, and if Be injured for all I care, provided I sin not against the gods. I would not have thee come to blows with Argos. I am of like mind in this; but I will not dismiss these from my protection. For all that, I shall take and drag my own away. Why then perhaps thou wilt find a difficulty in returning to Argos. That shall I soon find out by making the attempt. Touch them and thou shalt rue it, and that without delay. I conjure thee, never dare to strike a herald. Strike I will, unless that herald learn discretion. Depart; and thou, O king, touch him not. I go; for ’tis feeble fighting with a single arm. But I will come again, bringing hither a host of Argive troops, spearmen clad in bronze; for countless warriors are awaiting my return, and king Eurystheus in person at their head; And when he hears thy haughty answer, he will burst upon thee, and thy citizens, on this land and all that grows therein; for all in vain should we possess such hosts of picked young troops in Argos, should we forbear to punish thee. Perdition seize thee ! I am not afraid of thy Argos. Be very sure thou shalt not drag these suppliants hence by force, to my shame; for I hold not this city subject unto Argos, but independently. ’Tis time to use our forethought, ere the host of Argos approach our frontier, for exceeding fierce are the warriors of Mycenae, and in the present case still more than heretofore. For all heralds observe this custom, to exaggerate what happened twofold. Bethink thee what a tale he will tell his master of his dreadful treatment, how he came very near losing his life altogether. Children have no fairer prize than this, the being born of a good and noble sire, and the power to wed from noble families; but whoso is enslaved by passion and makes a lowborn match, I cannot praise for leaving to his children a legacy of shame, to gratify himself. For noble birth offers a stouter resistance to adversity than base parentage; we, for instance, in the last extremity of woe, have found friends and kinsmen here, the only champions of these children through all the length and breadth of this Hellenic world. Give, children, give to them your hand, and they the same to you; draw near to them. Ah! children, we have made trial of our friends, and if ever ye see the path that leads you back to your native land, and possess your home and the honours of your father, count them ever as your friends and saviours, and never lift against their land the foeman’s spear, in memory of this, but hold this city first midst those ye love. Yea, they well deserve your warm regard, in that So while I live, and after death,—come when it will,—loudly will I sing thy praise, good friend, and will extol thee as I stand at Theseus’ side, and cheer his heart, as I tell how thou didst give kind welcome and protection to the sons of Heracles, and how nobly thou dost preserve thy father’s fame through the length of Hellas, and hast not fallen from the high estate, to which thy father brought thee, a lot which few others can boast; for ’mongst the many wilt thou find one maybe, that is not degenerate from his sire. This land is ever ready in an honest cause to aid the helpless. Wherefore ere now it hath endured troubles numberless for friends, and now in this I see a struggle nigh at hand. Thou hast spoken well, and I feel confident their conduct will be such; our kindness will they not forget. Now will I muster the citizens and set them in array, that I may receive Mycenae’s host with serried ranks. But first will I send scouts to meet them, lest they fall upon me unawares; for at Argos every man is prompt to answer to the call, and I will assemble prophets and ordain a sacrifice. But do thou leave the altar of Zeus and go with the children into the house; for there are those, who will care for thee, even though I be abroad. Enter then my house, old man. I will not leave the altar. Let us sit here still, praying for the city’s fair success, and when thou hast made a glorious end of this struggle, will we go unto the house; nor are the gods who champion us weaker than the gods of Argos, O king; Hera, wife of Zeus, is their leader; Athena ours. And this I say is an omen of success, that we have the stronger deity, for Pallas will not brook defeat. Though loud thy boasts, there be others care no more for thee for that, O stranger But thou art void of sense, and so is he, who lords it o’er Argos, the son of Sthenelus, —thou that comest to another state, in no wise weaker than Argos, and, stranger that thou art, wouldst drag away by force suppliants of the gods, wanderers that cling at least in wise men’s judgment? I am for peace myself; yet I tell thee, wicked king, although thou come unto my city, thou shalt not get so easily what thou expectest. Thou art not the only man to wield a sword or targe with plates of brass. Nay, thou eager warrior, I warn thee, bring not war’s alarms against our lovely town; restrain thyself. My son, why, prithee, art thou returned with that anxious look? Hast thou news of the enemy? Are they coming, are they here, or what thy tidings? For of a surety yon herald will not play us false. No! sure I am their captain, prosperous heretofore, will come, with thoughts exceeding proud against Athens. But Zeus doth punish overweening pride. The host of Argos is come, and Eurystheus its king; my own eyes saw him, for the man who thinks he knows good generalship must see the foe not by messengers alone. As yet, however, he hath not sent his host into the plain, but, camped upon a rocky brow, is watching—I only tell thee what I think this means—to see by which road to lead his army hither without fighting, and how to take up a safe position in this land. However, all my plans are by this time carefully laid; the city is under arms, the victims stand ready to be slain to every god, whose due this is; my seers have filled the town with sacrifices, to turn the foe to flight and keep our country safe. All those who chant prophetic words have I assembled, and have examined ancient oracles, both public and secret, as means to save this city. And though the several answers differ in many points, yet in one is the sentiment of all clearly the same; they bid me sacrifice to Demeter’s Now I, though in your cause I am as zealous as thou seest, yet will not slay my child, nor will I compel any of my subjects to do so against his will; for who of his own will doth harbour such an evil thought as to yield with his own hands the child he loves? And now thou mayest Do thou then look to this and help to find a way to save yourselves and this country without causing me to be slandered by the citizens. For I am no despot like a barbarian monarch; but provided Can it be that heaven forbids this city to help strangers, when it hath the will and longing so to do? My children, we are even as those mariners, who have escaped the storm’s relentless rage, and have the land almost within their reach, but after all are driven back from shore by tempests to the deep again. Even so we, just as we reach the shore in seeming safety, are being thrust back from this land. Ah me! Why, cruel hope, didst thou then The king may well be pardoned, if he will not slay his subjects’ children; and with my treatment here I am content; if indeed ’tis heaven’s will, I thus should fare, still is my gratitude to thee in no wise lost. Children, I know not what to do for you. Whither shall we turn? for what god’s altar have we left uncrowned? to what fenced city have we failed to go? Ruin and surrender are our instant lot, poor children! If I must die, ’tis naught to me, save that thereby I give those foes of mine some cause for joy. But you, children, I lament and pity, and that aged mother of your sire, Alcmena. Ah, woe is thee for thy long span of life! and woe is me for all my idle toil! ’Twas after all our destined doom to fall into the hands of our hated foe, and die a death of shame and misery. But lend me thine aid, thou knowest how; for all hope of these children’s safety has not yet left me. Give me up instead of them to the Argives, O king; run no risk, but let me save the children; to love my life becomes me not; let it pass. Me for so, even if by fortune Old man, blame A generous scheme is thine, but impossible. ’Tis not in quest of thee yon king comes marching hither; what all this Eurystheus must foresee. But if thou hast any scheme besides, that better suits the time, be ready with it, for, since I heard that oracle, I am at a loss and full of fear. Sirs, impute not boldness to me, because I venture forth; this shall be my first request, for a woman’s fairest crown is this, to practise silence and discretion, and abide at home in peace. But when I heard thy lamentations, Iolaus, I came forth, albeit I was not appointed to take the lead in my family. Still in some sense am I fit to do so, for these my brothers are my chiefest care, and I fain would ask, as touching myself, whether some new trouble, added to the former woes, is gnawing at thy heart. My daughter, ’tis nothing new that I should praise thee, as I justly may, above all the children of Heracles. Our house seemed to be prospering, when back it fell again into a hopeless state; for the king declares the prophets signify that he must order the sacrifice, not of bull or heifer, but of some tender maid of noble lineage, if we and this city are to exist. Herein is our perplexity; the king refuses either to sacrifice his own or any other’s child. that, unless we find some way out of this perplexity, we must seek some other land, for he this country fain would save. Are these indeed the terms on which our safety depends? Yea, on these; if, that is, we are successful otherwise. No longer then cower before the hated Argive spear; for I, of my own free will, or ever they bid me, am ready to die and offer myself as a victim. For what excuse we, though we might save ourselves, fly from death, by foisting our trouble on others? No! indeed, ’twere surely most ridiculous to sit and mourn as suppliants of the gods, and show ourselves but cowards, children as we are of that illustrious sire. Where among the brave is such conduct seen? Better, I suppose, this city should be taken and I (which Heaven forefend!) fall into the hands of the enemy, and then, for all I am my noble father’s child, meet an awful doom, and face the Death-god none the less. Shall I wander as an exile from this land? Shall I not feel shame then, when someone says, as say they will, Nay, if these be slain and I alone be saved, I have no hope in any wise of being happy, though many ere now have in this hope betrayed their friends. For who will care to wed a lonely maid or make me mother of his children? ’Tis better I should die than meet such treatment, then be victorious o’er the foe, for here I offer my life freely and without constraint, and for my brothers and myself I undertake to die. Ah, what shall I say on hearing the maid’s brave words, she that is ready to die for her brothers? Who can Daughter, thou art his own true child, no other man’s but Heracles’, that godlike soul; proud am I of thy words, though I sorrow for thy lot. Yet will I propose a fairer method: ’tis right to summon hither all the sisters of this maiden, and then let her, on whom the lot shall fall, die for her family; for that thou shouldst die without the lot is not just. My death shall no chance lot decide; there is no graciousness in that; peace! old friend. But if ye accept and will avail you of my readiness, freely do I offer my life for these, and without constraint. Ah, this is even nobler than thy former word; that was matchless, but thou dost now surpass thy bravery and noble speech. I cannot bid, will not forbid thy dying, Omy daughter! for A cautious bidding thine! Fear not to take a stain of guilt from me; only let me die as one whose death is free. Follow me, old friend, for in thy arms I fain would die; stand by and veil my body with my robe, for I will go even to the dreadful doom of sacrifice, seeing whose daughter I avow myself. I cannot stand by and see thee bleed. At least do thou beg me this boon of the king, that I may breathe out my life in women’s arms instead of men’s. It shall be so, unhappy maid; for this were shame to me to refuse thee honour due, for many reasons: because thou hast a soul so brave; because ’tis right; and thou hast shown more courage than any of thy sex my eyes have ever seen. Now, if thou hast aught to say to these children or thy aged guide, oh Farewell, old friend, farewell! and prithee teach these children to be like thyself, wise at every point; let them strive no further, for that will suffice them. And seek to save them from death, even as thou art anxious to do; thy children are we, thy care it was that nurtured us. Thou seest how I yield my bridal bloom to die for them. For you, my brothers gathered here, may you be happy! and may every blessing be yours, for the which my blood shall pay the price! Alcmena, the aged mother of my sire, and these strangers too. And if ever heaven for you devise release from trouble and a return to your home, remember the burial due to her that saved you, a funeral fair but stood by you, and died to save my race. This shall be my pearl of price instead of children, and for the maiden life I leave, if there be really aught beyond the grave—God grant there may not be! For if, e’en there, we who are to die shall find a life of care, I know not whither one shall turn; for death is held a sovereign cure for every ill. Maiden of heroic soul, transcending all thy race, be sure the fame that thou shalt win from us, in life, in death, shall leave the rest of women far behind; farewell to thee! I dare not say harsh words of her to whom thou art devoted, the goddess-daughter of Demeter. For I am grieved at what hath happened, and yet, were it not fulfilled, we could not live; thus were the mischief worse, though this is grief enough. Without the will of heaven none is blest, none curst, I do maintain; nor doth the same house for ever tread To shun what fate decrees, is no wise permitted; none by cunning shall thrust it from him; but he, who vainly would do so, shall have unceasing trouble. Then fall not prostrate thou, but bear what heaven sends, and set a limit to thy soul’s grief; for she, poor maid! in dying for her brothers and this land, hath won a glorious death, and splendid fame shall be her meed from all mankind; for virtue’s path leads through troublous ways. Worthy of her father, worthy of her noble birth is this conduct. And if thou dost honour the virtuous dead, I share with thee that sentiment. All hail, ye children! Where is aged Iolaus? where the mother of your sire, absent from their place at this altar? Here am I, so far as I can be present at all. Why dost thou lie there? Why that downcast look? There is come a sorrow on my house, whereby I am distressed. Arise, lift up thy head. I am old, and all my strength is gone. But I come with tidings of great joy for thee. Who art thou? Where have I met thee? I have no remembrance. I am a vassal of Hyllus; dost not recognize me now? Best of friends, art thou come to save us twain from hurt? Assuredly; and moreover thou art lucky in the present case. Alcmena, mother of a noble son, to thee I call! come forth, hear this welcome news. For long has anguish caused thee inwardly to waste, wondering if those, who now are here, would ever come. What means that shout, that echoes throughout the house? Hath there come yet a herald from Argos, O Iolaus, and is he treating thee with violence? Feeble is any strength of mine; yet thus much let me tell thee, stranger, never, whilst I live, shalt thou drag them hence. Shouldst thou succeed, no more let me be thought the mother of that hero. And if thou lay a finger on them, thou wilt struggle to thy shame with two aged foes. Courage, aged dame, fear not; not from Argos is a herald come, with hostile messages. Why then didst raise a cry, fear’s harbinger? I called thee to come to me in front of this temple. I know not what it means; who is this? A messenger who says thy grandson cometh hither. All hail to thee for these thy tidings! But why is he not here, where is he? if in this land he hath set foot. What hath happened to keep him from coming hither with thee, to cheer my heart? He is posting the army he brought with him, and seeing it marshalled. Then have I no concern herein. Yes, thou hast; though it is my business to inquire into these matters. What then wouldst thou learn of these events? About how many allies has he with him? A numerous force; I cannot otherwise describe the number. The leaders of the Athenians know this, I suppose? They do; already is their left wing set in array. Is then the host already armed for battle? Yea, and already are the victims brought About what distance is the Argive host from us? Near enough for their general to be plainly seen. What is he about? marshalling the enemy’s line? So we guessed; we could not hear exactly. But I must go, for I would not that my master should engage the foe without me, if I can help it. I also will go with thee; for I like thee am minded, so it seems, to be there and help my friends. It least of all becomes thee thus to utter words of folly. Far less to shrink from sharing with my friends the stubborn fight. Mere looks can wound no one, if the arm do naught. Why, cannot I smite even through their shields? Smite perhaps, more likely be smitten thyself. No foe will dare to meet me face to face. Friend, the strength, that erst was thine, is thine no more, Well, at any rate, I will fight with as many as ever I did. Small the weight thou canst throw into the balance for thy friends. Detain me not, when I have girded myself for action. The power to act is thine no more, the will maybe is there. Stay here I will not, say what else How shalt thou show thyself before the troops unarmed? There be captured arms within this shrine; these will I use, and, if I live, restore; and, if I am slain, the god will not demand them of me back. Go thou within, and from its peg take down a suit of armour and forthwith bring it to me. To linger thus at home is infamous, while some go fight, and others out of cowardice remain behind. Not yet hath time laid low thy spirit, ’tis young as ever; but thy body’s strength is gone. Why toil to no purpose? ’Twill do thee hurt and benefit our city little. At thy age thou shouldst confess thy error and let impossibilities alone. Thou canst in no way get thy vigour back again. What means this mad resolve to leave me with my children undefended here? Men must fight; and thou must look to them. And what if thou art slain? what safety shall I find? Thy son’s surviving children will care for thee. Suppose they meet with some reverse? which Heaven forefend! These strangers will not give thee up, fear not. They are my last and only hope, I have no other. Zeus too, I feel sure, cares for thy sufferings. Ah! of Zeus will I never speak ill, but himself doth know, whether he is just to me. Lo! here thou seest a full coat of mail; make haste to case thyself therein; for the strife is nigh, and bitterly doth Ares loathe loiterers; but if thou fear the weight of the armour, go for the present without it, and in the ranks do on this gear; meantime will I carry it. Well said! keep the harness ready to my hand, put a spear within my grasp, and support me on the left side, guiding my steps. Am I to lead this warrior like a child? To save the omen, we must go without stumbling. Would thy power to act were equal to thy zeal! Hasten; I shall feel it grievously, if I am too late for the battle. ’Tis thou who art slow, not I, though thou fanciest thou art doing wonders. Dost not mark how swift my steps are hasting? I mark more seeming than reality in thy haste. Thou wilt tell a different tale when thou seest me there. What shall I see thee do? I wish thee all success, at any rate. Thou shalt see me smite some foeman through the shield. Perhaps, if ever we get there. I have my fears of that. Ah! would to Heaven that thou, mine arm, e’en as I remember thee in thy lusty youth, when with Heracles thou didst sack Sparta, couldst so champion me to-day! how I would put Eurystheus to flight! since he is too craven to wait the onslaught. For prosperity carries with it this error too a reputation for bravery; for we think the prosperous man a master of all knowledge. O earth, and moon that shines by night, and dazzling radiance of the god, that giveth light to man, bear the tidings to me, shout aloud to heaven for joy, and beside our ruler’s throne, and in the shrine of grey-eyed Athene. For my fatherland and home will I soon decide the issue of the strife with the gleaming sword, because I have taken suppliants under my protection. ’Tis a fearful thing, that a city prosperous as Mycenae is, one famed for martial prowess, should harbour wrath against my land; still, my countrymen, it were a shameful thing in us to yield up suppliant strangers at the bidding of Argos. Zeus is on my side, I am not afraid; Zeus hath a favour unto me, as is my due; never by me O dread goddess, from Argos with brandished lance against this land; for, such my worth, I little merit exile from my home. For thy worship when young voices sing and dancers’ music is heard abroad, while on our wind-swept hill goes up the cry of joy to the beat of maidens’ feet by night. Mistress, the message that I bring is very short for thee to hear and fair for me, who stand before thee, to announce. O’er our foes we are victorious, and trophies are being set up, with panoplies upon them, taken from thy enemies. Best of friends! this day hath wrought But there still remains one anxious thought thou dost not free me from;—a thought of fear;—are those, whose lives I cherish, spared to me? They are, and high their fame through all the army spreads. The old man Iolaus,—is he yet alive? Aye, that he is, a hero whom the gods delight to honour. How so? Did he perform some deed of prowess? He hath passed from age to youth once more. Thy tale is passing strange; but first I would that thou shouldst tell me, how our friends won the day. One speech of mine puts it all clearly before thee. When we had deployed our troops and marshalled them face to face with one another, Hyllus dismounted from his four-horsed chariot and stood midway betwixt the hosts. Then cried he, to come within reach of the stubborn spear, showing himself an abject coward; yet with such a spirit he came to enslave the children of Heracles. Then did Hyllus withdraw to his own ranks again, and the prophets seeing that no reconciliation would be effected by single combat, began the sacrifice without delay and forthwith let flow from a human as a highborn chieftain should, would exhort his host: Anon the Etrurian trumpet sounded loud and clear, and hand to hand they rushed; then think how loudly clashed their ringing shields, what din arose of cries and groans confused! At first the onset of the Argive spearmen broke our ranks; then they in turn gave ground; next, foot to foot and man to man, they fought their stubborn fray, many falling the while. And either chief cheered on his men, to take him up into his chariot. Thereon he seized the reins and went hard after the sacred to the goddess Athene, he caught sight of Eurystheus’ chariot, and prayed to Hebe and to Zeus, that for one single day he might grow young again and wreak his vengeance on his foes. Now must thou hear a wondrous tale: two stars settled on the horses’ yokes and threw the chariot into dark shadow, which—at least so say our wiser folk—were thy son and Hebe; and from that murky gloom appeared that aged man in the form of a youth with strong young arms; then by the rocks of Sciron the hero Iolaus o’ertakes Eurystheus’ chariot. And he bound his hands with gyves, and is bringing that chieftain once so prosperous as a trophy hither, whose fortune now doth preach a lesson, clear as day, to all the sons of men, that none should envy him, who seems to thrive, until they see his death; for fortune’s moods last but a day. O Zeus, who puttest my foes to flight, now may I behold the day that frees me from cruel fear! At last, O Zeus, hast thou turned a favouring eye on my affliction; yet do I thank thee for what has happened. And though ere this I did not believe my son was gathered to the gods, now am I convinced thereof. My children, now at last from toil shall ye be free, free from him, whom hideous death awaits, Eurystheus; now shall ye behold your father’s city, and set foot in the land of your inheritance, and sacrifice to those ancestral gods, from whom ye have been debarred and forced to lead in strangers’ lands a life of wretched vagrancy. But tell me, what sage purpose Iolaus nursed in his heart, that he spared the life of Eurystheus, for to my mind this is no wisdom, to catch a foe and wreak no vengeance on him. ’Twas his regard for thee, that thou might’st see him subject to thy hand, and triumph Rest assured, set me free; for, at such a time as this, sincerity becometh noble lips. Sweet is the dance to me, whenso the clear-toned flute and lovely Aphrodite shed grace upon the feast; and a joyful thing too it is, I trow, to witness the good luck of friends, who till then ne’er dreamt of it. For numerous is the offspring of Fate, that bringeth all to pass, and of Time, the son of Cronos. Thine is the path of justice, O my city; this must no man wrest from thee, thy reverence for the gods, and, whoso denieth it of thee, draws nigh to frenzy’s goal, with these plain proofs in view. Yea, for the god proclaims it clearly, by cutting short the bad man’s pride in every case. In heaven, mother, lives thy son, passed from earth away; that he went down to Hades’ halls, his body burnt by the fire’s fierce flame, is past belief; in golden halls reclined he has to wife Hebe, lovely nymph. Thou, O Hymen, hast honoured them, children both of Zeus. Things for the most part form a single chain; for instance, men say Athene used to champion their father, and now the citizens of that goddess have saved his children, and checked the insolence of him, whose heart preferred violence to justice. God save me from such arrogance, such greed of soul! Mistress, though thine eyes see him, yet will I announce we have brought Eurystheus hither for thy pleasure, an unexpected sight, for him no less a chance he ne’er foresaw; for little he thought of ever falling into thy hands, what time he marched from Mycenae with his toil-worn warriors, to sack Athens, thinking himself far above fortune. But a power divine hath reversed our destinies, changing their position. Now Hyllus and brave Iolaus I left raising sight to see a foe fall on evil days after prosperity. Art come, thou hateful wretch? Hath Justice caught thee then at last? First, turn thy head this way to me, and endure to look thy enemies in the face, for thou art no more the ruler, but the slave. Art and wouldst send him with an order to slay hydras and lions? Thy other evil schemes I mention not, for to tell them were a tedious task for me. Nor did it content thee to venture thus far only; no! but from all Hellas wouldst thou drive me and my children, heaven’s suppliants though we were, grey-heads some of us, and some still tender babes. But here hast thou found men and a free city, that feared not thee. Die in torment must thou, and e’en so wilt thou gain in every way, for one death is not thy due, after all the sorrow thou hast caused. Thou mayst not slay him. Then have we taken him captive in vain. But say, what law forbids his death? It is not the will of the rulers of this land. Why, what is this? Do they not approve of slaying enemies? Not such as they have taken alive in battle. Did Hyllus uphold this decision? He, I suppose, ought to have disobeyed the law of the land. The prisoner’s life ought not to have been spared a moment. It was then that he was wronged, by not being slain at first. Why, then, he is still in time to pay his penalty. There is no one, who will slay him now. I will; and yet I count myself someone. Well, thou wilt incur great blame, if thou do this deed. I love this city well; that cannot be gainsaid. But since this man hath fallen into my power, no mortal hand shall wrest him from me. Wherefore let who will, call me the woman bold, with thoughts too high for her sex; yet shall this deed be brought to pass by me. Lady, full well I understand thou hast a dire quarrel with this man, and ’tis pardonable. Woman, be sure I will not flatter thee nor say aught to save my life, that can give any occasion for a charge of cowardice. It was not of my own free will I took this quarrel up; I am aware that I was born thy cousin, and kinsman to Heracles, thy son; but whether I would or no, Hera, by her power divine, caused me to be afflicted thus. Still, when I undertook to be his foe, and when I knew I had to enter on this struggle, I set myself to devise trouble in plenty, and oft from time to time my midnight communing bore fruit, scheming how to push aside and slay my foes, and for the future divorce myself from fear; for I knew that son of thine was no mere cipher, but a man indeed; yea, for, though he was my foe, I will speak well of him, because he was a man of worth. Now, after he was taken hence, was I not forced, by reason of these children’s hatred, and because I was conscious of an hereditary feud, to leave no stone unturned by slaying, banishing, and plotting against them? So long as I did so, my safety was assured. Suppose thyself hadst had my lot, wouldst not thou have set to harassing the lion’s angry whelps, instead of letting them dwell at Argos undisturbed? Thou wilt not persuade us otherwise. when I was prepared to die, by the laws of Hellas my death becomes a curse on him, who slays me now. The city wisely let me go, in that she regarded the gods more than her hatred of me. Thou hast had my answer to thy words; henceforth must I be called avenging spirit Alcmena, fain I would advise thee somewhat; let this man go, for ’tis the city’s will. Suppose he die, and yet I obey the city? That would be best of all; but how can this be? I will teach thee easily. I will slay him and then give up his corpse to those of his friends, who come for it, for, as regards his body, I will not disobey but by his death shall he pay me the penalty. Slay me, I do not ask thee for mercy; yet since this city let me go and shrunk from slaying me, I will reward it with an old oracle of Loxias, which in time will benefit them more than doth appear. Bury my body after death in its destined grave in front of the shrine of the virgin goddess whensoe’er and would not betray me. Waste no drink-offering on my tomb, nor spill the victim’s blood; for I will requite them for my treatment here with a journey they shall rue; and ye shall have double gain from me, for I will help you and harm them by my death. Why, why delay to kill this man, after hearing this, since this is needed to secure the safety of your city and your children? Himself points out the safest road. Though the man is now our foe, yet after death is he our gain. Away with him, ye servants, and cast him I agree. Lead on, servants. Our  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             What mortal has not heard of the one who shared a wife with Zeus, Amphitryon of Argos, whom once Alcaeus, son of Perseus, begot, Amphitryon the father of Heracles? Who lived here in of the dragon’s teeth grew up a crop of earth-born giants; and of these Ares saved a scanty band, and their children’s children people the city of Cadmus. Hence sprung Creon, son of Menoeceus, king of this land; and Creon became the father of this lady Megara, whom once all Cadmus’ race escorted with the glad music of lutes at her wedding, when the famous Heracles led her to my halls. Now he, my son, left eager to make his home in to free the world of savage monsters, whether it was that Hera goaded him to submit to this, or that fate was leagued against him. Other toils he has accomplished, and last of all has he passed through the mouth of Taenarus into the halls of Hades to drag to the light that hound with three bodies, and from there he has never returned. Now there is an ancient legend among the race of Cadmus that a certain Lycus in days gone by was husband to Dirce, and he was king of this city with its seven towers, before Amphion and Zethus, sons of Zeus, lords of the milk-white steeds, became rulers in the land. His son, called by the same name as his father, although no Theban but a stranger from So this family connection with Creon is likely to prove to us a serious evil; for now that my son is in the bowels of the earth, this new monarch Lycus is bent on extirpating the children of Heracles, to quench one bloody feud with another, likewise his wife and me, if useless age like mine is to rank among men, that the boys may never grow up to exact a blood-penalty of their uncle’s family. So I, left here by my son, while he is gone into the pitchy darkness of the earth, to tend and guard his children in his house, am taking my place with their mother, that the race of Heracles may not perish, here at the altar of Zeus the Savior, which my own gallant child set up to commemorate his glorious victory over the Minyae. And here we are careful to keep our station, though in need of everything, of food, drink and clothes, huddled together on the hard bare ground; for we are barred out from our house and sit here for want of any other safety. As for friends, some I see are unreliable; while others, who are staunch, have no power to help us further. This is what misfortune means to man; may it never fall to the lot of any who bears the least goodwill to me, to apply this never-failing test of friendship! Old warrior, who once razed the citadel of the Taphians leading on the troops of possessed as he was of royal power, for which long spears are launched at the lives of the fortunate through love of it; children too he had; and he gave me to your son, matching me in glorious marriage with Heracles. And now all that is dead and gone from us; and I and you, old friend, are doomed to die, and these children of Heracles, whom I am guarding beneath my wing as a bird keeps her tender chicks under her. And they one after another keep asking me: What hope or way of salvation are you now devising, old friend? for I look to you. We can never steal beyond the boundaries of the land unseen, for there is too strict a watch set on us at every outlet, nor have we any longer hopes of safety in our friends. Whatever your scheme is, declare it, lest our death be made ready. It is by no means easy, my daughter, to give one’s earnest advice on such matters off hand, without weary thought; but let us prolong the time, since we are powerless to escape. Do you need a further taste of grief, or do you cling so fast to life? Yes, I love this life, and cling to its hopes. So do I; but you should not expect the unexpected, old friend. In these delays the only cure for our evils is left. It is the biting pain of that interval I feel so. Daughter, there may yet be a happy escape from present troubles for me and you; my son, your husband, may yet arrive. So calm yourself, and wipe those tears from your children’s eyes, and soothe them with soft words, inventing a tale to delude then, piteous though such fraud be. Yes, for even men’s misfortunes often flag, and the stormy wind does not always blow so strong, nor are the prosperous ever so; for all things change, making way for each other. The bravest man is he who relies ever on his hopes, but despair is the mark of a coward. To the sheltering roof, to the old man’s couch, leaning on my staff have I set forth, chanting a plaintive dirge like some bird grown grey, I that am only a voice and a fancy bred of the visions of sleep by night, palsied with age, yet meaning kindly. All hail! you orphaned children! all hail, old friend! you too, unhappy mother, wailing for your husband in the halls of Hades! Do not faint too soon upon your way, or let your limbs grow weary, as a colt beneath the yoke grows weary as he mounts some stony hill, dragging the weight of a wheeled chariot. Take hold of hand or robe, who ever feels his footsteps falter. Old friend, escort another like yourself, who once amid his toiling peers in the days of our youth would take his place beside you, no blot upon his country’s glorious record. See, how like their father’s sternly flash these children’s eyes! Misfortune has not failed his children, nor yet has his comeliness been denied them. O But I see Lycus, the ruler of this land, drawing near the house. One question, if I may, to this father of Heracles and his wife; and certainly as your lord and master I have a right to put what questions I choose. How long do you seek to prolong your lives? What hope, what aid do you see to save you from death? Do you trust that these children’s father, who lies dead in the halls of Hades, will return? How unworthily you show your sorrow at having to die, you and you, After all, what was the fine exploit your husband achieved, if he Are these your weapons for the hard struggle? Is it for this then that Heracles’ children should be spared? A man who has won a reputation for valor in his contests with beasts, in all else a weakling; who never buckled shield to arm nor faced the spear, but with a bow, that coward’s weapon, was ever ready to run away. Archery is no test of manly bravery; no! he is a man who keeps his post in the ranks and steadily faces the swift wound the spear may plough. My policy, again, old man, shows no reckless cruelty, but caution; for I am well aware I slew Creon, the father of this woman, and am in possession of his throne. So I have no wish that these children should grow up and be left to take vengeance on me in requital for what I have done. Let Zeus defend his his own share in his son; but as for me, Heracles, it is my concern on your behalf to prove by what I say this tyrant’s ignorance; for I cannot allow you to be ill spoken of. First then for that which should never have been said—for to speak of you, Heracles, as a coward is, I think, outside the pale of speech—of that must I clear you with heaven to witness. I appeal then to the thunder of Zeus, and the chariot in which he rode, when he pierced the Giants, earth’s brood, to the heart with his winged shafts, and with gods uplifted the glorious triumph song; or go to Pholoe and ask the insolent tribe of four-legged Centaurs, you craven king, ask them who they would judge the bravest of men; will they not say my son, who according to you is but a pretender? Were you to ask Euboean Dirphys, your native place, it would not sing your praise, for you have never done a single gallant deed to which your country can witness. Next you disparage that clever invention, an archer’s weapon; come, listen to me and learn wisdom. A man who fights in line is a slave to his weapons, and if his fellow-comrades want for courage he is slain himself through the cowardice of his neighbors, or, if he breaks his spear, he cannot defend his body from death, having only one means of defence; whereas all who are armed with the trusty bow, though they have but one weapon, yet is it the best; for a man, after discharging countless arrows, still has others with which to defend himself from death, and standing at a distance keeps off the enemy, wounding them for all their watchfulness with invisible shafts, and never exposing himself to the foe, but keeping under cover; and this is by far the wisest course in battle, to harm the enemy and keep safe oneself, independent of chance. These arguments completely contradict yours with regard to the matter at issue. Next, why are you desirous of slaying these children? What have they done to you? One piece of wisdom I credit you with, your coward terror of a brave man’s descendants. Still it is hard on us, if for your cowardice we must die; a fate that ought to have overtaken you at our braver hands, if Zeus had been fairly disposed towards us. But, if you are so anxious to make yourself supreme in the land, let us go into exile; abstain from all violence, else you will suffer by it whenever the god causes fortune’s breeze to veer round. Ah! you land of Cadmus—for to you too will I turn, distributing my words of reproach—is this your defense of Heracles and his children? the man who faced alone all the Minyans in battle and allowed to help these tender chicks, to requite him for all his labors in purging land and sea. Such help, my children, neither For the vigor which once I had, has gone from me; my limbs are palsied with age, and my strength is decayed. If I were young and still powerful in body, I would have seized my spear and dabbled those flaxen locks of his with blood, so that the coward would now be flying from my spear beyond the bounds of Atlas. Have not the brave among mankind a fair occasion for speech, although slow to begin? Say what you will of me in your exalted phrase, but I by deeds will make you rue those words.  all alive, that they may learn that the dead no longer rules this land, but that for the present I am king. misfortunes, and you shall never forget you are slaves and I your prince. —You sons of Earth, whom Ares once sowed, when from the dragon’s ravening jaw he had torn the teeth, up with your staves, on which you lean your hands, and dash out this villain’s brains! a fellow who, without even being a Theban, but a foreigner, lords it shamefully over the younger men; but my master shall you never be to your joy. —Nor shall you reap the harvest of all my toil; Go back to where you came from, in your insolence. For never while I live, shall you slay these sons of Heracles; not so deep beneath the earth has their father disappeared from his children’s ken. —You are in possession of this land which you have ruined, while he, its benefactor, has missed his just reward. —And yet do I take too much upon myself because I help those I love after their death, when most they need a friend? —Ah! right hand, how you desire to wield the spear, but your weakness is a death-blow to your desire. For then I would have stopped you calling me slave, and I would have governed Old men, I thank you; it is right that friends should feel virtuous indignation on behalf of those they love; but do not on our account vent your anger on the tyrant to your own undoing. Hear my advice, Amphitryon, if there appears to you to be anything in what I say. I love my children; strange if I did not love those whom I bore, whom I labored for! Death I count a dreadful fate; but the man who strives against necessity I esteem a fool. Since we must die, let us do so without being burnt alive, a source of mockery to our enemies, which to my mind is an evil worse than death; for much good do we owe our family. You have always had a warrior’s fair fame, so it is not to be endured that you should die a coward’s death; and my husband’s reputation needs no one to witness that he would never consent to save these children’s lives by letting them incur the stain of cowardice; for the noble are afflicted by disgrace on account of their children, nor must I shrink from following my lord’s example. As to your hopes consider how I weigh them. Do you think your son will return from beneath the earth? And who ever has come back from the dead out of the halls of Hades? But would you soften this man by entreaty? Oh no! better to fly from one’s enemy when he is so brutish, but yield to men of breeding and culture; for you would more easily conclude a friendly truce by accepting regard. True, a thought has already occurred to me that we might by entreaty obtain a sentence of exile for the children; yet this too is misery, to compass their deliverance with dire penury as the result; for it is a saying that hosts look sweetly on banished friends for a day and no more. Endure to die with us, for that awaits you after all. By your brave soul I challenge you, old friend; for whoever struggles hard to escape destiny sent by the gods shows zeal no doubt, but it is zeal with a taint of folly; for what must be, no one will ever avail to alter. If a man had insulted you, while yet my arms were strong, there would have been an easy way to stop him; but now am I am nothing ; and so you henceforth, Amphitryon, must scheme how to avert misfortune. It is not cowardice or any longing for life that hinders my dying, but my wish to save my son’s children, though no doubt I am longing for the impossible. See! here is my neck ready for the sword to pierce, to hack, to hurl from the rock; only one favor I crave for both of us, king; slay me and this hapless mother before you slay the children, that we may not see the hideous sight, as they gasp out their lives, calling on their mother and their father’s father; for the rest work your will if so you are inclined; for we have no defense against death. I too implore you add a second favor, that by your single act you may put us both under a double obligation; allow me to deck my children in the robes of death, first opening the palace gates, for now we are shut out, so that this at least they may obtain from their father’s halls. I grant it, and bid my servants undo the bolts. Go in and deck yourselves; robes do not grudge. But as soon as you have clothed yourselves, I will return to you to consign you to the nether world. Children, follow the footsteps of your hapless mother to your father’s house, where others possess his substance, though his name is still ours. O Zeus, in vain, it seems, did I get you to share my bride with me; in vain used we to call you partner in my son. After all you are less our friend than you pretended. Great god as you are, I, a mortal, surpass you in true worth. For I did not betray the children of Heracles; but you by stealth found your way to my bed, taking another’s wife without leave given, while to save your own friends you have no skill. Either you are a god of little sense, or else naturally unjust. Phoebus is singing a dirge, after his happier strains, for Linus dead in his beauty, striking his lyre with key of gold; but I wish to sing a song of praise, a crown to all his toil, on the one who has gone to the gloom beneath the nether world, whether I am to call him son of Zeus or of Amphitryon. For the virtue of noble toils is a glory to the dead. First he cleared the grove of Zeus of a lion, and put its skin upon his back, hiding his And then one day with murderous bow he wounded the race of wild Centaurs, that range the hills, slaying them with winged shafts. Peneus, the river of fair eddies, knows him well, and those far fields unharvested, and the steadings on And he slew that dappled deer with horns of gold, that preyed upon the country-folk, glorifying Artemis, huntress queen of Oenoe. Next he mounted on a chariot and tamed with the bit the horses of Diomedes, that greedily champed their bloody food at gory mangers with unbridled jaws, devouring with hideous joy the flesh of men; then crossing the heights of And at the strand of the Pelian gulf by the streams of Anaurus, he slew with his arrows Cycnus, murderer of his guests, the savage wretch who dwelt in Amphanae. And he came to those minstrel maids, to their orchard in the west, to pluck from the leafy apple-tree its golden fruit, when he had slain the tawny dragon, whose terrible coils were twined all round to guard it; and he made his way into ocean’s lairs, bringing calm to men that use the oar. And he stretched out his hands to uphold the firmament, seeking the home of Atlas, and on his manly shoulders took the starry mansions of the gods. Then he went through the waves of heaving Euxine against the mounted host of Amazons dwelling round Maeotis, the lake that is fed by many a stream, having gathered to his standard all his friends from a deadly quest for a girdle. He burned to ashes the many-headed water-snake, and smeared its venom on his darts, with which he slew the shepherd of Erytheia, a monster with three bodies. And many another glorious achievement he brought to a happy issue; to Hades’ house of tears has he now sailed, the goal of his labors, where he is ending his career of toil, nor does he come back again. Now your house is left without a friend, and Charon’s boat awaits your children to bear them on that journey out of life, without return, contrary to the gods’ law and man’s justice; and it is to your prowess that your house is looking although you are not here. Had I been strong and lusty, able to brandish the spear in battle’s onset, and my Theban companions too, I would have stood by your children to champion them; but now my happy youth is gone and I am left. But look! I see the children of Heracles who was once so great, wearing the clothes of the dead, and his loving wife dragging her babes along at her side, and Heracles’ aged father. Ah! woe is me! no longer can I stem the flood of tears that spring to my old eyes. Come now, who is to sacrifice or butcher these poor children? old men and young ones and mothers, all together. Alas! for my sad fate and my children’s, whom these eyes now for the last time behold. So I gave you birth and reared you only for our foes to mock, to jeer at, and slay. Ah me! how bitterly my hopes have disappointed me in the expectation I once formed from the words of your father. and over your head would he throw that lion’s skin with which he himself was armed. And and to your hand he used to resign the carved club, his sure defence, pretending to give it to you. And to would your father exalt you, his three sons, proud of your manliness; while I was choosing the best brides for you, scheming to link you by marriage to And now that is all vanished; fortune’s breeze has veered and given to you for brides the maidens of death in their stead, and my tears will be the marriage bath; woe is me for my foolish thoughts! and your grandfather here is celebrating your marriage-feast, the cares of a father, accepting Hades as the father of your brides. Ah me! which of you shall I first press to my bosom, which last? on which bestow my kiss, or clasp close to me? Oh! would that like the bee with russet wing, I could collect from every source my sighs in one, and, blending them together, shed them in one copious flood! O my dearest Heracles, to you I call, if perhaps mortal voice can make itself heard in Hades’ halls; your father and children are dying, and I am doomed, I who once because of you was counted blessed as men count bliss. Come to our rescue; appear, I pray, if only as a phantom, since your arrival, even as a dream, would be enough, for they are cowards who are slaying your children. Lady, prepare the funeral rites; but I, O Zeus, stretching out my hand to heaven, call on you to help these children, if such is your intention; for soon any aid of yours will be unavailing; and yet you have been often invoked; my toil is in vain; death seems inevitable. You aged friends, the joys of life are few; so take heed that you pass through it as gladly as you may, without a thought of sorrow from morning until night; for time takes little heed of preserving our hopes; and, when he has busied himself on his own business, away he flies. Look at me, a man who had made a mark among his fellows by deeds of note; yet fortune in a single day has robbed me of it as of a feather that floats away toward the sky. I know not any whose plenteous wealth and high reputation is fixed and sure; fare you well, for now you have seen the last of your old friend, my comrades. Ah! Old friend, is it my own, my dearest I see? or what am I to say? I do not know, my daughter; I too am struck dumb. Is this he who they told us was beneath the earth?It is, unless some day-dream mocks our sight. What am I saying? What visions do these anxious eyes behold? Old man, this is no one other than your own son. Come here, my children, cling to your father’s robe, hurry, never loose your hold, for here is one to help you, not at all behind our savior Zeus. All hail! my house and gates of my home, how glad I am to emerge to the light and see you. Ah! what is this? I see my children before the house in the robes of death, with chaplets on their heads and my wife amid a throng of men, and my father weeping—what misfortune? Let me draw near to them and inquire; lady, what strange stroke of fate has fallen on the house? Dearest of all mankind to me! O ray of light appearing to your father! Are you safe and is your coming just in time to help your dear ones? What do you mean? What is this confusion I find on my arrival, father? We are being ruined; forgive me, old friend, if I have anticipated that to which you had a right to tell him; for women’s nature is perhaps more prone to grief than men’s and they are my children that were being led to death, which was my own lot too. Apollo! what a prelude to your story! My brothers are dead, and my old father. How so? what did he do? whose spear did he meet? Lycus, our new monarch, slew him. Did he meet him in fair fight, or was the land sick and weak? Yes, from faction; now he is master of the city of Cadmus with its seven gates. Why has panic fallen on you and my aged father? He meant to kill your father, me, and my children. What are you saying? What did he have to fear from my orphan babes? He was afraid they might some day avenge Creon’s death. What is this dress they wear, suited to the dead? It is the garb of death we have already put on. And were you being forced to die? O woe is me! Yes, deserted by every friend, and informed that you were dead. What put such desperate thoughts into your heads? That was what the heralds of Eurystheus kept proclaiming. Why did you leave my hearth and home? He forced us; your father was dragged from his bed. Had he no shame, to ill-use the old man so? Shame indeed! that goddess and he dwell far enough apart. Was I so poor in friends in my absence? Who are the friends of a man in misfortune? Do they make so light of my hard warring with the Minyans? Misfortune, to repeat it to you, has no friends. Cast from your heads these chaplets of death, look up to the light, for instead of the darkness below your eyes behold the welcome sun. I, meanwhile, since here is work for my hand, will first go raze this upstart tyrant’s halls, and when I have beheaded the villain, I will throw him to dogs to tear; and every Theban who I find has played the traitor after my kindness, will I destroy with this victorious club; the rest will I tear apart with my feathered shafts and fill Ismenus full of bloody corpses, and Dirce’s clear stream shall run red with gore. For whom ought I to help rather than wife and children and aged father? Farewell my labors! for it was in vain I accomplished them rather than helping these. And yet I ought to die in their defence, since they for their father were doomed; or what shall we find so noble in having fought a hydra and a lion at the commands of Eurystheus, if I make no effort to save my own children from death? No longer then, as before, shall I be called Heracles the victor. It is only right that parents should help their children, their aged fathers, and the partners of their marriage. My son, it is like you to show your love for your dear ones and your hate for your enemies; only curb excessive hastiness. How, father, am I now showing more than fitting haste? The king has a host of allies, needy villains though pretending to be rich, who sowed dissension and overthrew the state with a view to plundering their neighbors; for the wealth they had in their houses was all spent, dissipated by their sloth. You were seen entering the city; and, that being so, beware that you do not bring your enemies together and be slain unawares. Little I care if the whole city saw me; but happening to see a bird perched in an unlucky position, from it I learned that some trouble had befallen my house; so on purpose I made my entry to the land by stealth. Well done; now, on your arrival, go salute your household altar, and let your father’s halls behold your face. For soon the king will be here in person to drag away your wife and children and murder them, and to add me to the bloody list. But if you remain on the spot all will go well, and you will profit by this security; but do not rouse your city before you have these matters well in train, my son. I will do so; your advice is good; I will enter my house. After my return at length from the sunless den of Hades and the maiden queen of hell, I will not neglect to greet first of all the gods beneath my roof. Did you really go to the house of Hades, my son? Yes, and brought to the light that three-headed monster. Did you conquer him in fight, or receive him from the goddess? In fight; for I had been lucky enough to witness the rites of the initiated. Is the monster really lodged in the house of Eurystheus? The grove of Demeter and the city of Eurystheus does not know that you have returned to the upper world? He does not; I came here first to learn your news. How is it you were so long beneath the earth? I stayed awhile attempting to bring back Theseus from Hades, father. Where is he? gone to his native land? He set out for and no more let the tears stream from your eyes; you too, my wife, collect your courage, cease from fear; leave go my robe; for I cannot fly away, nor have I any wish to flee from those I love. Ah! they do not loose their hold, but cling to my garments all the more; were you on the razor’s edge of danger? Well, I must lead them, taking them by the hand to draw them after me, my little boats, like a ship when towing; for I too do not reject the care of my children; here all mankind are equal; all love their children, both those of high estate and those who are nothing; it is wealth that makes distinctions among them; some have, others want; but all the human race loves its offspring. Dear to me is youth always, but old age is hanging over my head, a burden heavier than to barter for houses stored with gold my happy youth, which is in wealth and poverty alike most fair! But old age is gloomy and deadly; I hate it; let it sink beneath the waves! Would it had never found its way to the homes and towns of mortal men, but were still drifting on for ever down the wind. Had the gods shown discernment and wisdom, as mortals count these things, men would have won youth twice over, a visible mark of worth among whomever found, and after death these would have run a double course once more to the sun-light, while the low born would have had a single portion of life; and thus would it have been possible to distinguish the good and the bad, just as sailors know the number of the stars amid the clouds. But, as it is, the gods have set no certain boundary between good and bad, but time’s onward roll brings increase only to man’s wealth. Never will I cease to link in one the Graces and the Muses, sweetest union. Never may I live among uneducated boors, but ever may I find a place among the crowned! Yes, still the aged singer lifts up his voice of bygone memories: still is my song of the triumphs of Heracles, whether Bromius the giver of wine is near, or the strains of the seven-stringed lyre and the Libyan pipe are rising; not yet will I cease to sing the Muses’ praise, my patrons in the dance. The maids of the graceful dancer; so I with my old lips will cry aloud songs of joy at your palace-doors, like the swan, aged singer; for there is a good theme for minstrelsy; he is the son of Zeus; yet high above his noble birth tower his deeds of prowess, for his toil secured this life of calm for man, having destroyed all fearsome beasts. Amphitryon, it is high time you came forth from the palace; you have been too long arraying yourselves in the robes and trappings of the dead. Come, bid the wife and children of Heracles show themselves outside the house, to die on the conditions you yourselves offered. Lord, you persecute me in my misery and heap insult upon me over and above the loss of my son; you should have been more moderate in your zeal, though you are my lord and master. But since you impose death’s necessity on me, I must acquiesce; what you wish must be done. Now, where is Megara? where are the children of Alcmena’s son? She, I believe, so far as I can guess from outside— What grounds do you have to base your fancy on? Is sitting as a suppliant on the altar’s hallowed steps— Imploring them quite uselessly to save her life. And calling on her dead husband, in vain. He is nowhere near, and he certainly will never come. No, unless perhaps a god should raise him from the dead. Go to her and bring her from the palace. By doing so I should become an accomplice in her murder. Since you have this scruple, I, who have left fear behind, will myself bring out the mother and her children. Follow me, servants, that we may joyfully put an end to this delay of our work. Then go your way along the path of fate; for what remains, maybe another will provide. Expect for your evil deeds to find some trouble yourself.  Ah! my aged friends, he is marching fairly to his doom; soon will he lie entangled in the snare of the sword, thinking to slay his neighbors, the villain! I will go, to see him fall dead; for the sight of a foe being slain and paying the penalty of his misdeeds affords pleasurable feelings. Evil has changed sides; he who was once a mighty king is now turning his life backward into the road to Hades. Hail to you! Justice and heavenly retribution. At last have you reached the goal where your death will pay the penalty, for your insults against your betters. Joy makes my tears burst forth. He has come back— which I never once thought in my heart would happen—the prince of the land. Come, old friends, let us look within to see if someone has met the fate I hope. Ah me! ah me! Ha! how sweet to hear that opening note of his within the house; death is not far off him now. The prince cries out, wailing a prelude of death. O kingdom of Cadmus, I am perishing by treachery! You were yourself for making others perish; endure your retribution; it is only the penalty of your own deeds you are paying. Who was he, only a mortal, that aimed his silly saying at the blessed gods of heaven with impious blasphemy, maintaining that they are weaklings after all? Old friends, our godless foe is now no more. The house is still; let us turn to the dance. Yes, for fortune smiles upon my friends as I desire. Dances, dances and banquets now prevail throughout the holy town of For change from tears, change from sorrow give birth to song. The new king is gone; our former monarch rules, having made his way even from the harbor of The gods, the gods take care to heed the right and wrong. It is their gold and their good luck that lead men’s hearts astray, bringing in their train unjust power. For no man ever had the courage to reflect what reverses Time might bring; but, disregarding law to gratify lawlessness, he shatters the black chariot of prosperity. O Ismenus, deck yourself with garlands! Break forth into dancing, you paved streets of our seven-gated city! come Dirce, fount of waters fair; and joined with her you nymphs of Asopus, come from your father’s waves to add your voices to our hymn, the victor’s prize that Heracles has won. O Pythian rock with forests crowned, and haunts of the Muses on Helicon! you will come to my city and her walls with cries of joy; where the earth-born crop sprang to view, a warrior-host with shields of brass, who are handing on their realm to children’s children, a divine light to All hail the marriage! in which two bridegrooms shared; the one, a mortal; the other, Zeus, who came to wed the bride sprung from Perseus; for that marriage of yours, O Zeus, in days gone by has been proved to me a true story beyond all expectation; and time has shown the brightness of Heracles’ strength; for he emerged from caverns beneath the earth after leaving Pluto’s halls below. To me you are a worthier lord than that base-born king, who now lets it be plainly seen in this struggle between armed warriors, whether justice still finds favor in heaven. —Ha! see there, my old comrades! is the same wild panic fallen on us all; what phantom is this I see hovering over the house? —Fly, fly, bestir your tardy steps! begone! away! —O savior prince, avert calamity from me! Courage, old men! she, whom you see, is Madness, daughter of Night, and I am Iris, the handmaid of the gods. We have not come to do your city any hurt, but our warfare is against the house of one man only, against him whom they call the son of Zeus and Alcmena. For until he had finished all his grievous labors, Destiny was preserving him, nor would father Zeus ever suffer me or Hera to harm him. But now that he has accomplished the labors of Eurystheus, Hera wishes to brand him with the guilt of shedding kindred blood by slaying his own children, and I wish it also. Come then, unwed maid, child of black Night, harden your heart relentlessly, send forth frenzy upon this man, confound his mind even to the slaying of his children, drive him, goad him wildly on his mad career, shake out the sails of death, that when he has conveyed over he may learn to know how fiercely against him the wrath of Hera burns and may also experience mine; otherwise, if he should escape punishment, the gods will become as nothing, while man’s power will grow. Of noble parents was I born, the daughter of Night, sprung from the blood of Ouranos; and these prerogatives I hold, not to use them in anger against friends, nor do I have any joy in visiting the homes of men; and I wish to counsel Hera, before I see her make a mistake, and you too, if you will hearken to my words. This man, against whose house you are sending me, has made himself a name alike in heaven and earth; for, after taming pathless wilds and raging sea, he by his single might raised up again the honors of the gods when sinking before man’s impiety; . . . wherefore I counsel you, do not wish him dire mishaps. Spare us your advice on Hera’s and my schemes. I seek to turn your steps into the best path instead of into this one of evil. It was not to practice self-control that the wife of Zeus sent you here. I call the sun-god to witness that here I am acting against my will; but if indeed I must at once serve you and Hera and follow you in full cry as hounds follow the huntsman, then I will go; neither ocean with its fiercely groaning waves, nor the earthquake, nor the thunderbolt with blast of agony shall be like the headlong rush I will make into the breast of Heracles; through his roof will I burst my way and swoop upon his house, after first slaying his children; nor shall their murderer know that he is killing the children he begot, till he is released from my madness. Behold him! see how even now he is wildly tossing his head at the outset, and rolling his eyes fiercely from side to side without a word; nor can he control his panting breath, like a fearful bull in act to charge; he bellows, calling on the goddesses of nether hell. Soon will I rouse you to yet wilder dancing and pipe a note of terror in your ear. Soar away, O Iris, to Alas alas! lament; the son of Zeus, flower of your city, is being cut down. Woe to you, She is mounted on her chariot, the queen of sorrow and sighing, and is goading on her steeds, as if for outrage, the Gorgon child of Night, with a hundred hissing serpent-heads, Madness of the flashing eyes. Soon has the god changed his good fortune; soon will his children breathe their last, slain by a father’s hand. Ah me! alas! O Zeus, unjust Vengeance, mad, relentless, will soon give your childless son up to misery. Alas, O house! The dance begins without the cymbals’ crash, with no glad waving of the wine-god’s staff— Woe to these halls! Toward bloodshed, and not to pour libations of Dionysus’ grape. O children, make haste to fly! That is the chant of death, of death, to the music of pipes. Ah, yes! he is hunting the children down. Never will Madness lead her revel rout in vain. Ah misery! Ah me! how I lament that aged father, that mother too that bore his children in vain. Look! look! A tempest rocks the house; the roof is falling with it. Oh, oh! what are you doing, Pallas, child of Zeus, to the house? You are sending hell’s confusion against the halls, as once you did on Enceladus. O white-haired old men! Why this loud address to me? It is dreadful within! No need for me to call another prophet for that. The children are dead. Alas! Ah weep! for here is cause for weeping. A cruel murder, cruel parents’ hands! No words can utter more than we have suffered. How came the ruin you reveal, the ruin that must be lamented, from a father to his children? Tell me how these heaven-sent woes came rushing on the house; say how the children met their sad mischance. Victims to purify the house were stationed before the altar of Zeus, for Heracles had slain and cast from his halls the king of the land. There stood his group of lovely children, with his father and Megara; and already the basket was being passed round the altar, and we were keeping holy silence. But just as Alcmena’s son was bringing the torch in his right hand to dip it in the holy water, he stopped without a word. And as their father lingered, his children looked at him; he was no longer himself; his eyes were rolling; he was quite distraught; his eyeballs were bloodshot, and foam was oozing down his bearded cheek. He spoke with a madman’s laugh: Then he set out, and though he had no chariot there, he thought he had, and was for mounting to its seat, and using a goad as though his fingers really held one. A twofold feeling filled his servants’ breasts, amusement and fear at once; and one looking to his neighbor said: and going into the house, he threw himself upon the floor, as he was, and made ready to feast. But after waiting a brief space he began saying he was on his way to the plains amid the valleys of the Isthmus; and then stripping himself of his mantle, he fell to competing with no one, and he proclaimed himself victor with his own voice, calling on no one to listen. Next, fancy carrying him to Mycenae, he was uttering fearful threats against Eurystheus. Meantime his father caught him by his stalwart arm, and thus addressed him: and made ready his quiver, thinking to slay the sons of Eurystheus. And they in wild fright darted here and there, one to his hapless mother’s skirts, another to the shadow of a pillar, while a third cowered beneath the altar like a bird. Then cried their mother: sprinkling the stone pillars with blood as he gasped out his life. Then Heracles shouted in triumph and boasted loud: at the altar’s foot thinking to escape unseen. But before he fired, the poor child threw himself at his father’s knees, and, flinging his hand to reach his beard or neck, cried: But that other, with savage Gorgon-scowl, as the child now stood in range of his baleful archery, smote him on the head, as a smith strikes his molten iron, bringing down his club upon the fair-haired boy, and crushed the bones. The second caught, away he goes to add a third victim to the other two. But before he could, the poor mother caught up her child and carried him within the house and shut the doors. But he, as though he really were at the Cyclopean walls, prized open the doors with levers, and, hurling down their posts, with one shaft laid low his wife and child. Then in wild gallop he starts to slay his aged father; but there came a phantom, as it seemed to us on-lookers, of Pallas, with plumed helm, brandishing a spear; and she hurled a rock against the breast of Heracles, which held him from his frenzied thirst for blood and plunged him into sleep; to the ground he fell, striking his back against a column that had fallen on the floor shattered in two when the roof fell in. Then we rallied from our flight, and with the old man’s aid bound him fast with knotted cords to the pillar, so that on his awakening he might do no further mischief. So there he sleeps, poor wretch! a sleep that is not blessed, having murdered wife and children; no, for my part I do not know any mortal more miserable than he. That murder wrought by the daughters of Danaus, which the rock of has outrun those former horrors . . . for the unhappy son of Zeus. I could tell of the murder done by Procne, mother of an only child, offered to the Muses; but you had three children, wretched parent, and all of them have you in your frenzy slain. Alas! What groans or wails, what funeral dirge, or dance of death am I to raise? Ah, ah! see, the bolted doors of the lofty palace are being rolled apart. Ah me! see the wretched children lying before their unhappy father, who is sunk in dreadful slumber after shedding their blood. Round him are bonds and cords, made fast with many knots about the body of Heracles, and lashed to the stone columns of his house. But he, the aged father, like mother-bird wailing her unfledged brood, comes hastening here with halting steps on his bitter journey. Softly, softly! you aged sons of For you, old friend, I weep and mourn, for the children too and that victorious chief. Stand further off, make no noise nor outcry, do not rouse him from his calm deep slumber. O horrible! all this blood— Hush, hush! you will be my ruin. That he has spilled is rising up against him. Gently raise your dirge of woe, old friends; or he will wake, and, bursting his bonds, destroy the city, rend his father, and dash his house to pieces. I cannot, cannot— Hush! let me note his breathing; come, let me put my ear close. Is he sleeping? Yes, he is sleeping, a deadly sleepless sleep, having slain wife and children with the arrows of his twanging bow. Ah! mourn— Indeed I do. The children’s death— Ah me! And your own son’s doom. Alas! Old friend— Hush! hush! he is turning over, he is waking! Oh! let me hide myself, concealed beneath the roof. Courage! darkness still holds your son’s eye. Oh beware! it is not that I shrink from leaving the light after my miseries, poor wretch! but if should he slay me, his father, then he will be devising mischief on mischief, and to the avenging curse will add a parent’s blood. Well for you if you had died in that day, when, for your wife, you went forth to exact vengeance for her slain brothers by sacking the Taphians’ sea-beat town. Fly, fly, my aged friends, from before the palace, escape his waking fury. Or soon he will heap up fresh slaughter on the old, ranging wildly once more through the streets of O Zeus, why have you shown such savage hate against your own son and plunged him in this sea of troubles? Aha! I am alive and breathing; and my eyes resume their function, opening on the sky and earth and the sun’s darting beam; but how my senses reel! in what strange turmoil am I plunged! my fevered breath in quick spasmodic gasps escapes my lungs. How now? why am I lying here, my brawny chest and arms made fast with cables like a ship, beside a half-shattered piece of masonry, with corpses for my neighbors; while over the floor my bow and arrows are scattered, that once like trusty squires to my arm both kept me safe and were kept safe by me? Surely I have not come a second time to Hades’ halls, having just returned from there for Eurystheus? To Hades? From where? No, I do not see Sisyphus with his stone, or Pluto, or his queen, Demeter’s child. Surely I am distraught; where am I, so helpless? Ho, there! which of my friends is near or far to cure me in my perplexity? For I have no clear knowledge of things once familiar. My aged friends, shall I approach the scene of my sorrow? Yes, and let me go with you, not desert you in your trouble. Father, why do you weep and veil your eyes, standing far from your beloved son? My child! mine still, for all your misery. Why, what is there so sad in my case that you weep? That which might make any of the gods weep, if he were to learn it. A bold assertion that, but you are not yet explaining what has happened. Your own eyes see that, if by this time you are restored to your senses. Fill in your sketch if any change awaits my life. I will explain, if you are no longer mad as a fiend of hell. Oh! what suspicions these dark hints of yours again excite! I am still doubtful whether you are in your sober senses. I have no recollection of being mad. Am I to loose my son, old friends, or what shall I do? Loose me, yes, and say who bound me; for I feel shame at this. Rest content with what you know of your woes; the rest forego. No. for is silence sufficient to learn what I wish? O Zeus, do you behold these deeds proceeding from the throne of Hera? What! have I suffered something from her enmity? A truce to the goddess! attend to your own troubles. I am undone; you will tell me some mischance. See here the corpses of your children. O horror! what sight is here? ah me! My son, against your children you have waged unnatural war. War! what do you mean? who killed these? You and your bow and some god, whoever is to blame. What are you saying? what have I done? Speak, father, you messenger of evil! You were insane; it is a sad explanation you are asking. Was it I that slew my wife also? Your own unaided arm has done all this. Alas! a cloud of mourning wraps me round. For this reason I lament your fate. Did I dash my house to pieces in my frenzy? I know nothing but this, that you are utterly undone. Where did the madness seize me? where did it destroy me? When you were purifying yourself with fire at the altar. Ah me! why do I spare my own life when I have become the murderer of my dear children? Shall I not hasten to leap from some sheer rock, or aim the sword against my heart and avenge my children’s blood, or burn my body, which she drove mad, in the fire and so avert from my life the infamy which now awaits me? But here I see Theseus coming to check my deadly counsels, my kinsman and friend. Now shall I stand revealed, and the dearest of my friends will see the pollution I have incurred by my children’s murder. Ah, woe is me! what am I to do? Where can I find freedom from my sorrows? shall I take wings or plunge beneath the earth? Come, let me veil my head in darkness; for I am ashamed of the evil I have done, and, since for these I have incurred fresh blood-guiltiness, I do not want to harm the innocent. I have come, and others with me, young warriors from the land of to bring an allied army to your son, old friend. For a rumour reached the city of the Erechtheidae, that Lycus had usurped the scepter of this land and had become your enemy even to battle. Wherefore I came making recompense for the former kindness of Heracles in saving me from the world below, if you have any need of such aid as I or my allies can give, old man. Ha! why this heap of dead upon the floor? Surely I have not delayed too long and come too late to check a revolution? Who slew these children? whose wife is this I see? Boys do not go to battle; no, it must be some other strange mischance I here discover. O king, whose home is that olive-clad hill! Why this piteous prelude in addressing me? The gods have afflicted us with grievous suffering. Whose are these children, over whom you weep? My own son’s children, woe is him! he was their father and butcher both, hardening his heart to the bloody deed. Hush! good words only! I would I could obey! What dreadful words! Fortune has spread her wings, and we are ruined, ruined. What do you mean? what has he done? Slain them in a wild fit of frenzy with arrows dipped in the venom of the hundred-headed hydra. This is Hera’s work; but who lies there among the dead, old man? My son, my own enduring son, that marched with gods to Phlegra’s plain, there to battle with giants and slay them, warrior that he was. Ah, ah! whose fortune was ever so cursed as his? Never will you find another mortal that has suffered more or been driven harder. Why does he veil his head, poor wretch, in his robe? He is ashamed to meet your eye; his kinsman’s kind intent and his children’s blood make him abashed. But I come to sympathize; uncover him. My son, remove that mantle from your eyes, throw it from you, show your face to the sun. As a counterweight, fighting along with my tears, I entreat you as a suppliant, as I grasp your beard, your knees, your hands, and let fall the tear from my old eyes. O my child! restrain your savage lion-like temper, for you are rushing forth on an unholy course of bloodshed, eager to join mischief to mischief, child. What! Enough! To you I call who are huddled there in your misery, show to your friends your face; for no darkness is black enough to hide your sad mischance. Why do you wave your hand at me, signifying murder? is it that I may not be polluted by speaking with you? If I share your misfortune, what is that to me? For once I had good fortune with you. I must refer to the time when you brought me safe from the dead to the light of life. I hate a friend whose gratitude grows old; one who is ready to enjoy his friends’ prosperity but unwilling to sail in the same ship with them when they are unfortunate. Arise, unveil your head, poor wretch! and look on me. The gallant soul endures such blows as heaven deals and does not refuse them. O Theseus, did you see this struggle with my children? I heard of it, and now I see the horrors you mean. Why then have you unveiled my head to the sun? Why have I? you, a mortal, can not pollute what is of the gods. Try to escape, luckless wretch, from my unholy taint. The avenging fiend does not go forth from friend to friend. For this I thank you; I do not regret the service I did you. While I, for kindness then received, now show my pity for you. Ah yes! I am piteous object, a murderer of my sons. I weep for you in your changed fortunes. Did you ever find another more afflicted? Your misfortunes reach from earth to heaven. Therefore I am resolved on death. Do you suppose the gods attend to your threats? The god has been remorseless to me; so I will be the same to the gods. Hush! lest your presumption add to your sufferings. My ship is freighted full with sorrow; there is no room to stow anything further. What will you do? Where is your fury drifting you? I will die and return to that world below from which I have just come. Such language is fit for any common fellow. Ah! yours is the advice of one outside sorrow. Are these indeed the words of Heracles, the much-enduring? Though never so much as this. Endurance must have a limit. Is this the benefactor and great friend to mortals? Mortals bring no help to me; no! Hera has her way. Never would Hear me a moment, that I may enter the contest with arguments in answer to your admonitions; and I will unfold to you why life now as well as formerly has been unbearable to me. First I am the son of a man who incurred the guilt of blood, before he married my mother Alcmena, by slaying her aged father. Now when the foundation is badly laid at birth, it is necessary for the race to be cursed with woe; and Zeus, whoever this Zeus may be, begot me as an enemy to Hera; yet do not be vexed, old man; for you rather than Zeus I regard as my father. Then while I was being suckled, that bedfellow of Zeus foisted into my cradle fearsome snakes to cause my death. After I took on a cloak of youthful flesh, of all the toils I then endured what need to tell? what did I not destroy, whether lions, or triple-bodied Typhons, or giants or the battle against the hosts of four-legged Centaurs? or how when I had killed the hydra, that monster with a ring of heads with power to grow again, I passed through a herd of countless other toils besides and came to the dead to fetch to the light at the bidding of Eurystheus the three-headed hound, hell’s porter. Last, ah, woe is me! I have dared this labor, to crown the sorrows of my house with my children’s murder. I have come to this point of necessity; no longer may I dwell in Shall I go to Now to one who was once called happy, such changes are a grievous thing; though he who is always unfortunate feels no such pain, for sorrow is his birthright. This, I think, is the piteous pass I shall one day come to; for earth will cry out forbidding me to touch her, the sea and the river-springs will refuse me a crossing, and I shall become like Ixion who revolves in chains upon that wheel. And so this is best, that I should be seen by no one of the Hellenes, among whom in happier days I lived in bliss. What right have I to live? what profit can I have in the possession of a useless, impious life? So let that noble wife of Zeus dance, beating her foot in its shoe; for now has she worked her heart’s desire in utterly confounding the first of the benefactors of This is the work of none other of the gods than the wife of Zeus; you are right in that surmise. I cannot counsel you . . . rather than to go on suffering. There is not a man alive that has wholly escaped misfortune’s taint, nor any god either, if what poets sing is true. Have they not intermarried in ways that law forbids? Have they not thrown fathers into ignominious chains to gain the sovereign power? Still they inhabit And yet what shall you say in your defence, if you, a child of man, take your fate excessively hard, while they, as gods, do not? No, then, leave I will give you homes and the half of all I have. Yes, I will give you all those presents I received from the citizens for saving their fourteen children, when I slew the bull of be called after you by men, while you live; and at your death, when you have gone to Hades’ halls, the whole city of for citizens to win from No! this is quite beside the question of my troubles. For my part, I do not believe that the gods indulge in unholy unions; and as for putting bonds on hands, I have never thought that worthy of credit nor will I now be so persuaded, nor again that one god is naturally lord and master of another. For the deity, if he be really such, has no wants; these are miserable tales of the poets. But I, for all my piteous plight, reflected whether I should let myself be branded as a coward for giving up my life. For whoever does not withstand disasters will never be able to withstand even a man’s weapon. I will be steadfast in living; I will go to your city, with grateful thanks for all you offer me. But I have tasted of countless troubles, as is well known; never yet did I faint at any or shed a single tear; no, nor did I ever think that I should come to this, to let the tear-drop fall. But now, it seems, I must be fortune’s slave. Well, let it pass; my old father, you see me go forth to exile, and in me you see my own children’s murderer. Give them burial, and lay them out in death with the tribute of a tear, for the law forbids my doing so. Rest their heads upon their mother’s bosom and fold them in her arms, sad fellowship, which I, alas! unwittingly did slay. And when you have buried these dead, live on here still, in bitterness maybe, but still constrain your soul to share my sorrows. O children! he who begot you, your own father, has been your destroyer, and you have had no profit of my triumphs, all my restless toil to win for you by force a fair name, a glorious advantage from a father. You too, unhappy wife, this hand has slain, a poor return to make you for preserving the honor of my bed so safely, for all the weary watch you long have kept within my house. Alas for you, my wife, my sons! alas for me, how sad my lot, cut off from wife and child! Ah! these kisses, bitter-sweet! these weapons which it is pain to own! I am not sure whether to keep or let them go; dangling at my side they thus will say, No! I must not let them go, but keep them, though it grieves me. In one thing, Theseus, help my misery; come to O land of Cadmus, and all you people of cut off your hair, and mourn with me; go to my children’s burial, and with one dirge lament us all, the dead and me; for on all of us has Hera inflicted the same cruel blow of destruction. Rise, unhappy man! you have had your fill of tears. I cannot rise; my limbs are rooted here. Yes, even the strong are overthrown by misfortunes. Ah! Would I could become a stone upon this spot, oblivious of trouble. Peace! give your hand to a friend and helper. No, let me not wipe off the blood upon your robe. Wipe it off and spare not; I will not refuse you. Bereft of my own sons, I find you as a son to me. Throw your arm about my neck; I will be your guide. A pair of friends indeed, but one a man of sorrows. Ah! aged father, this is the kind of man to make a friend. Blessed in her sons, the country that gave him birth! Theseus, turn me back again to see my children. What for? Do you think to find a drug in this to soothe your soul? I long to do so, and would embrace my father. Here am I, my son; your wish is no less dear to me. Have you so short a memory for your troubles? All that I endured before was easier to bear than this. If anyone sees you play the woman, they will scoff. Have I by living grown so abject in your sight? It was not so once, I think. Yes, too much so; in your sickness you are not the glorious Heracles. What about you? What kind of hero were you when in trouble in the world below? I was worse than anyone as far as courage went. How then can you say of me, that I am abased by my troubles? Forward! Farewell, my aged father! Farewell to you, my son! Bury my children as I said. But who will bury me, my son? I will. When wil you come? After you have buried my children. How? I will fetch you from Whoever prefers wealth or might to the possession of good friends, thinks wrongly. With grief and many a bitter tear we go our way, robbed of all we prized most dearly.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Wide o’er man my realm extends, and proud the name that I, the goddess Cypris, bear, both in heaven’s courts and ’mongst all those who dwell within the limits of the sea those that respect my power I advance to honour, but bring to ruin all who vaunt themselves at me. For even in the race of gods this feeling finds a home, even pleasure at the honour men pay them. And the truth of this I soon will show; for that son of Theseus, born of the Amazon, Hippolytus, whom holy Pittheus taught, alone of all the dwellers in this land of Troezen, calls me vilest of the deities. Love he scorns, and, as for marriage, will none of it; but Artemis, daughter of Zeus, sister of Phoebus, he doth honour, counting her the chief of goddesses, and ever through the greenwood, attendant on his virgin goddess, he dears the earth of wild beasts with his fleet hounds, enjoying the comradeship of one too high for mortal ken. ’Tis not this I grudge him, no! why should I? But for his sins against me, I will this very day take vengeance on Hippolytus; for long ago I cleared the ground of many obstacles, so it needs but trifling toil. For as he came one day from the home of Pittheus to witness the solemn mystic rites and be initiated therein in Pandion’s land, And ere she came to this Troezenian realm, a temple did she rear to Now, when Theseus left the land of Cecrops, flying the pollution of the blood of Pallas’ and none of her servants knows what ails her. But this passion of hers must not fail thus. No, I will discover the matter to Theseus, and all shall be laid bare. Then will the father slay his child, my bitter foe, by curses, for the lord Poseidon granted this boon to Theseus; three wishes of the god to ask, nor ever ask in vain. So Phaedra is to die, an honoured death ’tis true, but still to die; for I will not let her suffering outweigh the payment of such forfeit by my foes as shall satisfy my honour. But lo! I see the son of Theseus coming hither—Hippolytus, fresh from the labours of the chase. I will get me hence. At his back follows a long train of retainers, in joyous cries of revelry uniting and hymns of praise to Artemis, his goddess; for little he recks that Death hath oped his gates for him, and that this is his last look upon the light. Come follow, friends, singing to Artemis, daughter of Zeus, throned in the sky, whose votaries we are. Lady goddess, awful queen, daughter of Zeus, all hail! hail! child of Latona and of Zeus, peerless mid the virgin choir, who hast thy dwelling in heaven’s wide mansions at thy noble father’s court, in the golden house of Zeus. All hail! most beauteous Artemis, lovelier far than all the daughters of Olympus! For where nor shepherd dares to herd his flock nor ever scythe hath mown, but o’er the mead unshorn the bee doth wing its way in spring; and with the dew from rivers drawn purity that garden tends. Such as know no cunning lore, yet in whose nature self-control, made perfect, hath a home, these may pluck the flowers, but not the wicked world. Accept, I pray, dear mistress, mine this chaplet from my holy hand to crown thy locks of gold; for I, and none other of mortals, have this high guerdon, to be with thee, with thee converse, hearing thy voice, though not thy face beholding. So be it mine to end my life as I began. My prince! we needs must call upon the gods, our lords, so wilt thou listen to a friendly word from me? Why, that will I! else were I proved a fool. Dost know, then, the way of the world? Not I; but wherefore such a question? It hates reserve which careth not for all men’s love. And rightly too; reserve in man is ever galling. But there’s a charm in courteous affability? The greatest surely; aye, and profit, too, at trifling cost. Dost think the same law holds in heaven as well? I trow it doth, since all our laws we men from heaven draw. Why, then, dost thou neglect to greet an august goddess? Whom speak’st thou of? Keep watch upon thy tongue lest it some mischief cause. Cypris I mean, whose image is stationed o’er thy gate. I greet her from afar, preserving still my chastity. Yet is she an august goddess, far renowned on earth. ’Mongst gods as well as men we have our several preferences. I wish thee luck, and wisdom too, so far as thou dost need it. No god, whose worship craves the night, hath charms for me. My son, we should avail us of the gifts that gods confer. Go in, my faithful followers, and make ready food within the house; a well-filled board hath charms after the chase is o’er. Rub down my steeds ye must, that when I have had my all I may yoke them to the chariot and give them proper exercise. As for thy Queen of Love, a long farewell to her. Meantime I with sober mind, for I must not copy my young master, do offer up my prayer to thy image, lady Cypris, in such words as it becomes a slave to use. But thou should’st pardon all, who, in youth’s impetuous heat, speak idle words of thee; make as though thou hearest not, for gods must needs be wiser than the sons of men. A rock there is, where, as they say, the ocean dew distils, and from its beetling brow it pours a copious stream for pitchers to be dipped therein; ’twas here I had a friend washing robes of purple in the trickling stream, and she was spreading them out on the face of a warm sunny rock; from her I had the tidings, first of all, that my mistress And this is the third day I hear that she hath closed her lovely lips and denied her chaste body all sustenance, eager to hide her suffering and reach death’s cheerless bourn. Maiden, thou must be possessed, by Pan made frantic or by Hecate, or by the Corybantes dread, and Cybele the mountain mother. Or maybe thou hast sinned against Dictynna, huntress-queen, and art wasting for thy guilt in sacrifice upon the ocean’s tossing billows. Or doth some rival in thy house beguile thy lord, the captain of Erechtheus’ sons, that hero nobly bom, to secret amours hid from thee? Or hath some mariner sailing hither from Crete reached this port that sailors love, with evil tidings for our queen, and she with sorrow for her grievous fate is to her bed confined? Yea, and oft o’er woman’s wayward nature settles a feeling of miserable perplexity, arising from labour-pains or passionate desire. I, too, have felt at times this sharp thrill shoot through me, but I would cry to Artemis, queen of archery, who comes from heaven to aid us in our travail, and thanks to heaven’s grace she ever comes at my call with welcome help. Look! where the aged nurse is bringing her forth from the house before the door, while on her brow the cloud of gloom is deepening. My soul longs to learn what is her grief, the canker that is wasting our queen’s fading charms. O, the ills of mortal men! the cruel diseases they endure! What can I do for thee? from what refrain? Here is the bright sun-light, here the azure sky; lo! we have brought thee on thy bed of sickness without the palace; for all thy talk was of coming hither, but soon back to thy chamber wilt thou hurry. Disappointment follows fast with thee, thou hast no joy in aught for long; the present has no power to please; on something absent next thy heart is set. Better be sick than tend the sick; the first is but a single ill, the last unites mental grief with manual toil. Man’s whole life is full of anguish; no respite from his woes he finds; but if there is aught to love beyond this life, night’s dark pall doth wrap it round. And so we show our mad love of this life because its light is shed on earth, and because we know no other, and have naught revealed to us of all our earth may hide; and trusting to fables we drift at random. Lift my body, raise my head! My limbs are all unstrung, kind friends. O handmaids, lift my arms, my shapely arms. The tire on my head is too heavy for me to wear; away with it, and let my tresses o’er my shoulders fall. Be of good heart, dear child; toss not so wildly to and fro. Lie still, be brave, so wilt thou find thy sickness easier to bear; suffering for mortals is nature’s iron law. Ah! would I could draw a draught of water pure from some dew-fed spring, and lay me down to rest in the grassy meadow ’neath the poplar’s shade! My child, what wild speech is this? O say not such things in public, wild whirling words of frenzy bred! Away to the mountain take me! to the wood, to the pine-trees I will go, where hounds pursue the prey, hard on the scent of dappled fawns. Ye gods! what joy to hark them on, to grasp the barbed dart, to poise Thessalian hunting-spears close to my golden hair, then let them fly. Why, why, my child, these anxious cares? What hast thou to do with the chase? Why so eager for the flowing spring, when hard by these towers stands a hill well watered, whence thou may’st freely draw? O Artemis, who watchest o’er sea-beat Limna would I were upon thy plains curbing Venetian steeds! Why betray thy frenzy in these wild whirling words? Now thou wert for hasting hence to the hills away to hunt wild beasts, and now thy yearning is to drive the steed over the waveless sands. This needs a cunning seer to say what god it is that reins thee from the course, distracting thy senses, child. Ah me! alas! what have I done? Whither have I strayed, my senses leaving? Mad, mad! stricken by some demon’s curse! Woe is me! Cover my head again, nurse. Hide me then; from my eyes the tear-drops stream, and for very shame I turn them away. Tis painful coming to one’s senses again, and madness, evil though it be, has this advantage, that one has no knowledge of reason’s overthrow. There then I cover thee; but when will death hide my body in the grave? Many a lesson length of days is teaching me. Yea, mortal men should pledge themselves to moderate friendships only, not to such as reach the very heart’s core; affection’s ties should be light upon them to let them slip or draw them tight. For one poor heart to grieve for twain, as I do for my mistress, is a burden sore to bear. Men say that too engrossing pursuits in life more oft cause disappointment than pleasure, and too oft are foes to health. Wherefore I do not praise excess so much as moderation, and with me wise men will agree. O aged dame, faithful nurse of Phaedra, our queen, we see her sorry plight; but what it is that ails her we cannot discern, so fain would learn of thee and hear thy opinion. I question her, but am no wiser, for she will not answer. Nor tell what source these sorrows have? The same answer thou must take, for she is dumb on every point. How weak and wasted is her body! What marvel? ’tis three days now since she has tasted food. Is this infatuation, or an attempt to die? ’Tis death she courts; such fasting aims at ending life. A strange story! is her husband satisfied? She hides from him her sorrow, and vows she is not ill. Can he not guess it from her face? He is not now in his own country. But dost not thou insist in thy endeavour to find out her complaint, her crazy mind? I have tried every plan, and all in vain; yet not even now will I relax my zeal, that thou too, if thou stayest, mayst witness my devotion to my unhappy mistress. Come, come, my darling child, let us forget, the twain of us, our former words; be thou more mild, smoothing that sullen brow and changing the current of thy thought, and I, if in aught before I failed in humouring thee, will let that be and find some better course. If thou art sick with ills thou canst not name, there be women here to help to set thee right; but if thy trouble can to men’s ears be divulged, speak, that physicians may pronounce on it. Come, then, why so dumb? Thou shouldst not so remain, my child, but scold me if I speak amiss, or, if I give good counsel, yield assent. One word, one look this way! Ah me! Friends, we waste our toil to no purpose; we are as far away as ever; she would not relent to my arguments then, nor is she yielding now. Well, grow more stubborn than the sea, yet be assured of this, that if thou diest thou art a traitress to thy children, for they will ne’er inherit their father’s halls, nay, by that knightly queen the Amazon e’en Hippolytus. Oh! oh! Ha! doth that touch the quick? Thou hast undone me, nurse; I do adjure by the gods, mention that man no more. There now! thou art thyself again, but e’en yet refusest to aid thy children and preserve thy life. My babes I love, but there is another storm that buffets me. Daughter, are thy hands from bloodshed pure? My hands are pure, but on my soul there rests a stain. The issue of some enemy’s secret witchery? A friend is my destroyer, one unwilling as myself. Hath Theseus wronged thee in any wise? Never may I prove untrue to him Then what strange mystery is there that drives thee on to die? O, let my sin and me alone! ’tis not ’gainst thee I sin. Never willingly! and, if I fail, ’twill rest at thy door. How now? thou usest force in clinging to my hand. Yea, and I will never loose my hold upon thy knees. Alas for thee! my sorrows, shouldst thou learn them, would recoil on thee. What keener grief for me than failing to win thee? ’Twill be death to thee; though to me that brings renown. And dost thou then conceal this boon despite my prayers? I do, for ’tis out of shame I am planning an honourable escape. Tell it, and thine honour shall the brighter shine. Away, I do conjure thee; loose my hand. I will not, for the boon thou shouldst have granted me is denied. I will grant it out of reverence for thy holy sup- pliant touch. Henceforth I hold my peace; ’tis thine to speak from now. Ah! hapless mother, Her love for the bull? daughter, or what meanest thou? And woe to thee! my sister, What ails thee, child? speaking ill of kith and kin. Myself the third to suffer! how am I undone! Thou strik’st me dumb! Where will this history end? That I know no more of what I fain would learn. Ah! would thou couldst say for me what I have to tell. I am no prophetess to unriddle secrets. What is it they mean when they talk of people being in At once the sweetest and the bitterest thing, my child. I shall only find the latter half. Ha! my child, art thou in love? The Amazon’s son, whoever he may be,— Mean’st thou Hippolytus? ’Twas thou, not I, that spoke his name. O heavens! what is this, my child? Thou hast ruined me. Outrageous! friends; I will not live and bear it; hateful is life, hateful to mine eyes the light. This body I resign, will cast it off, and rid me of existence by but something greater far, for she hath been the ruin of my lady and of me and our whole family. O, too clearly didst thou hear our queen uplift her voice to tell her startling tale of piteous suffering. Come death ere I reach thy state of feeling, O horrible! woe, for these miseries! woe, for the sorrows on which mortals feed! Thou art undone! thou hast disclosed thy sin to heaven’s light. What hath each passing day and every hour in store for thee? Some strange event will come to pass in this house. For it is no longer uncertain where the star of thy love is setting, thou hapless daughter Ladies of Troezen, who dwell here upon the frontier edge of Pelops’ land, oft ere now in heedless mood through the long hours of night have I wondered why man’s life is spoiled; and it seems to me their evil case is not due to any natural fault of judgment, for there be many dowered with sense, but we must view the matter in this light; by teaching and experience we learn the right but neglect it in practice, some from sloth, others from preferring pleasure of some kind or other to duty. Now life has many pleasures, protracted talk, and leisure, that seductive evil; likewise there is shame which is of two kinds, one a noble quality, the other a curse to families; but if for each its proper time were clearly known, these twain could not have had the selfsame letters to denote them. So then since I had made up my mind on these points, ’twas not likely any drug would alter it and make me think the contrary. And I will tell thee too the way my judgment went. When love wounded me, I bethought me how I best might bear the smart. So from For I put no faith in counsellors, who know well to lecture others for presumption, yet themselves have countless troubles of their own. Next I did devise noble endurance of these wanton thoughts, striving by continence for victory. And last when I could not succeed in mastering love hereby, methought it best to die; and none can gainsay my purpose. For fain I would my virtue should to all appear, my shame have few to witness it. I knew my sickly passion now; to yield to it I saw how infamous; and more, I learnt to know so well that I was but a woman, a thing the world detests. Curses, hideous curses on that wife, who first did shame her marriage-vow for lovers other than her lord! ’Twas from noble families this curse began to spread among our sex. For when the noble countenance disgrace, poor folk of course will think that it is right. Those too I hate who make profession of purity, though in secret reckless sinners. How can these, queen Cypris, ocean’s child, e’er look their husbands in the face? do they never feel one guilty thrill that their accomplice, night, or the chambers of their house will find a voice and speak? This it is that calls on me to die, kind friends, that so I may ne’er be found to have disgraced my lord, or the children I have born; no! may they grow up and dwell in glorious Athens, free to speak and act, heirs to such fair fame as a mother can bequeath. For to know that father or mother have sinned doth turn the stoutest heart to slavishness. This alone, men say, can stand the buffets of life’s battle, a just and virtuous soul in whomsoever found. For time unmasks the villain sooner or later, holding up to them a mirror as to some blooming maid. ’Mongst such may I be never seen! Now look! how fair is chastity however viewed, whose fruit is good repute amongst men. My queen, ’tis true thy tale of woe, but lately told, did for the moment strike me with wild alarm, but now I do Wilt thou, because thou lov’st, destroy thyself? ’Tis little gain, I trow, for those who love or yet may love their fellows, if death must be their end; for though the Love-Queen’s onset in her might is more than man can bear, yet doth she gently visit yielding hearts, and only when she finds a proud unnatural spirit, doth she take and mock it past belief. Her path is in the sky, and mid the ocean’s surge she rides; from her all nature springs; she sows the seeds of love, inspires the warm desire to which we sons of earth all owe our being. They who have aught to do with books of ancient scribes, or themselves engage in studious pursuits, know how Zeus of Semele was enamoured, how the bright-eyed goddess of the Dawn once stole Cephalus to dwell in heaven for the love she bore him; yet these in heaven abide nor shun the gods’ approach, content, I trow, to yield to their misfortune. Wilt thou refuse to yield? thy sire, it seems, should have begotten thee on special terms or with different gods for masters, if in these laws thou wilt not acquiesce. How many, prithee, men of sterling sense, when they see their wives unfaithful, make as though they saw it not? How many fathers, when their sons have gone astray, assist them in their amours? ’tis part of human wisdom to conceal the deed of shame. Nor should man aim at excessive refinement in his life; for e’en the roof that covers in a house; and how dost thou, after falling into so deep a pit, think to escape? Nay, if thou hast more of good than bad, thou wilt fare exceeding O cease, my darling child, from evil thoughts, let wanton pride be gone, for this is naught else, this wish to rival gods in perfectness. Face thy love; ’tis heaven’s will thou shouldst. Sick thou art, yet turn thy sickness to some happy issue. For there are charms and spells to soothe the soul; surely some cure for thy disease will be found. Men, no doubt, might seek it long and late if our women’s minds no scheme devise. Although she gives thee at thy present need the wiser counsel, Phaedra, yet do I praise thee. Still my praise may sound more harsh and jar more cruelly on thy ear than her advice. ’Tis even this, too plausible a tongue, that overthrows good governments and homes of men. We should not speak to please the ear but point the path that leads to noble fame. What means this solemn speech? No need of rounded phrases; ne’er would I to gratify thy passions have urged thee to this course; but now ’tis a struggle fierce to save thy life, and therefore less to blame. Accursed proposal! peace, woman! never utter those shameful words again! Shameful, maybe, yet for thee better than honour’s code. Better this deed, if it shall save thy life, than that name thy pride will kill thee to retain. I conjure thee, go no further! for thy words are plausible but infamous; for though as yet love has not If thou art of this mind, ’twere well thou ne’er hadst sinned; but as it is, hear me; for that is the next best course; I in my house have charms to soothe thy love,—’twas but now I thought of them;—these shall cure thee of thy sickness on no disgraceful terms, thy mind unhurt, if thou wilt be but brave. Is thy drug a salve or potion? I cannot tell; be content, my child, to profit by it and ask no questions. I fear me thou wilt prove too wise for me. If thou fear this, confess thyself afraid of all; but why thy terror? Lest thou shouldst breathe a word of this to Theseus’ son. Peace, my child! I will do all things well; only be thou, queen Cypris, ocean’s child, my partner in the work! And for the rest of my purpose, it will be enough for me to tell it to Our friends within the house. O Love, Love, that from the eyes diffusest soft desire, bringing on the souls of those, whom thou dost camp against, sweet grace, O never in evil mood appear to me, nor out of time and tune approach! Nor fire nor meteor hurls a mightier bolt than Aphrodite’s shaft shot by the hands of Love, the child of Zeus. Idly, idly by the streams of Alpheus and in the Pythian shrines of Phoebus, Hellas sweetest bower,—worship not him who, when he comes, lays waste and marks his path to mortal hearts by wide-spread woe. There was that maiden and gave unto Alcmena’s son, mid blood and smoke and murderous marriage-hymns, to be to him a frantic fiend of hell; woe! woe for his wooing! Ah! holy walls of Thebes, ah! fount of Dirce, ye could testify what course the love-queen follows. For with the blazing levin-bolt did she cut short the fatal marriage of Semele, mother of Zeus-bom Bacchus. All things she doth inspire, dread goddess, winging her flight hither and thither like a bee. Peace, ladies, peace! I am undone. What, Phaedra, is this dread event within thy house? Hush! let me hear what those within are saying. I am silent; this is surely the prelude to mischief. Great gods! how awful are my sufferings! What a cry was there! what loud alarm! say what sudden terror, lady, doth thy soul dismay. I am undone. Stand here at the door and hear the noise arising in the house. Thou art already by the bolted door; ’tis for thee to note the sounds that issue from within. And tell me, O tell me what mischief can be on foot. ’Tis the son of the horse-loving Amazon who calls, Hippolytus, uttering foul curses on my servant. I hear a noise, but cannot clearly tell Yes, yes, he is calling her plainly enough a go-between in vice, traitress to her master’s honour. Woe, woe is me! thou art betrayed, dear mistress! What counsel shall I give thee? thy secret is out; thou art utterly undone. Ah me! ah me! Betrayed by friends! She hath ruined me by speaking of my misfortune; ’twas kindly meant, but an ill way to cure my malady. O what wilt thou do now in thy cruel dilemma? I only know one way, one cure for these my woes and that is instant death. O mother earth! O sun’s unclouded orb! What words, unfit for any lips, have reached my ears! Peace, my son, lest some one hear thy outcry. I cannot hear such awful words and hold my peace. I do implore thee by thy fair right hand. Let go my hand, touch not my robe. O by thy knees I pray, destroy me not utterly. Why say this, if, as thou pretendest, thy lips are free from blame? My son, this is no story to be noised abroad. A virtuous tale grows fairer told to many. Never dishonour thy oath, thy son. My tongue an oath did take, but not my heart. My son, what wilt thou do? destroy thy friends? Friends indeed! the wicked are no friends of mine. O pardon me; to err is only human, child. Great Zeus, why didst thou, to man’s sorrow, put woman, evil counterfeit, to dwell where shines the sun? If but in thy temples they should have paid gold or iron or ponderous bronze and bought a family, each man proportioned to his offering, and so in independence dwelt, from women free. while the husband, who takes the noxious weed into his home, fondly decks his sorry idol in fine raiment and tricks her out in robes, squandering by degrees, unhappy wight! his house’s wealth. For he is in this dilemma; say his marriage has brought him good connections, he is glad then to keep the wife he loathes; or, if he gets a good wife but useless relations, he tries to stifle the bad luck with the good. But it is easiest for him who has settled in his house as wife a mere nobody, I hate a clever woman; never may she set foot in my house who aims at knowing more than women need; for in these clever women Cypris implants a larger store of villainy, while the artless woman is by her shallow wit from levity debarred. No servant should ever have had access to a wife, but men should put to live with them beasts, which bite, not talk, in which case they could not speak to any one nor be answered back by them. But, as it is, the wicked in their chambers plot wickedness, and their servants carry it abroad. Even thus, vile wretch, thou cam’st to make me partner in an outrage on my father’s honour; wherefore I must wash that stain away in running streams, dashing the water into my ears. How could I commit so foul a crime when by the very mention of it I feel myself Theseus is abroad, and will maintain strict silence. But, when my father comes, I will return and see how thou and thy mistress face him, and so shall I learn by experience the extent of thy audacity. Perdition seize you both! women, no! not even though some say this is ever my theme, for of a truth they always are evil. So either let some one prove them chaste, or let me still trample on them for ever. O the cruel, unhappy fate of women! What arts, what arguments have we, once we have made a slip, to loose by craft What god will appear to help me, what mortal to take my part or help me in unrighteousness? The present calamity of my life admits of no escape. Most hapless I of all my sex! Alas, alas! the deed is done, thy servant’s schemes have gone awry, my queen, and all is lost. Accursed woman! traitress to thy friends! How hast thou ruined me! May Zeus, my ancestor, smite thee with his fiery bolt and uproot thee from thy place. Did I not foresee thy purpose, did I not bid thee keep silence on the very matter which is now my shame? But thou wouldst not be still; wherefore my fair name will not go with me to the tomb. But now I must another scheme devise. Yon youth, in the keenness of his fury, will tell his father of my sin, and the aged Pittheus of my state, and fill the world Mistress, thou may’st condemn the mischief I have done, for sorrow’s sting o’ermasters thy judgment; yet can I answer thee in face of this, if thou wilt hear. ’Twas I who nurtured thee; I love thee still; but in my search for medicine to cure thy sickness I found what least I sought. Had I but succeeded, I had been counted wise, for the credit we get for wisdom is measured by our success. Is it just, is it any satisfaction to me, that thou shouldst wound me first, then bandy We dwell on this too long; I was not wise, I own; but there are yet ways of escape from the trouble, my child. Be dumb henceforth; evil was thy first advice to me, evil too thy attempted scheme. Begone and leave me, look to thyself; I will my own fortunes for the best arrange. Ye noble daughters of Troezen, grant me the only boon I crave; in silence bury what ye here have heard. By majestic Artemis, child of Zeus, I swear I will never divulge aught of thy sorrows. ’Tis well. But I, with all my thought, nor will I, to save one poor life, face Theseus after my disgrace. Art thou bent then on some cureless woe? On death; the means thereto must I devise myself. Hush! Do thou at least advise me well. For this very day shall I gladden Cypris, my destroyer, by yielding up my life, and shall own myself vanquished by cruel love. Yet shall my dying be another’s curse, that he may learn not to exult at my misfortunes; but when he comes to share the self-same plague with me, he will take a lesson in wisdom. O to be nestling ’neath some pathless cavern, there by god’s creating hand to grow into a bird amid the winged tribes! Away would I soar to Adrians wave-beat shore and to the waters of Eridanus; where a father’s hapless daughters distil into the glooming flood the amber brilliance of their tears. And to the apple-bearing strand of those minstrels in the west I then would come, where ocean’s lord no more to sailors grants a passage o’er the deep dark main, finding there the heaven’s holy bound, upheld by Atlas, where water from ambrosial founts wells up beside the couch of Zeus inside his halls, and holy earth, the bounteous mother, causes joy to spring in heavenly breasts. O white-winged bark, that o’er the booming ocean-wave didst bring my royal mistress from her happy home, to crown her queen ’mongst sorrow’s brides! Surely evil omens from either port, at least from Crete, were with that ship, what time to glorious Athens it sped its way, and the crew made fast its twisted cable-ends upon the beach of Munychus, and on the land stept out. Whence comes it that her heart is crushed, cruelly afflicted by Aphrodite with unholy love; so she by bitter grief o’erwhelmed will tie a noose within her bridal bower to fit it to her fair white neck, too modest for this hateful lot in life, prizing o’er all her name and fame, and striving thus to rid her soul of passion’s sting. Help! Woe worth the day! the deed is done; our royal mistress is no more, dead she hangs in the dangling noose. Haste! Friends, what shall we do? think you we should enter the house, and loose the queen from the tight-drawn noose? Why should we? Are there not young servants here? To do too much is not a safe course in life. Lay She is dead, poor lady, so I hear. Already are they laying out the corpse. Ladies, can ye tell me what the uproar in the palace means? There came the sound of servants weeping bitterly to mine ear. None of my household deign to open wide the gates and give me glad welcome as a traveller from prophetic shrines. Hath aught befallen old Pittheus? No. Though he be well advanced in years, yet should I mourn, were he to quit this house. ’Tis not against the old, Theseus, that fate, to strike thee, aims this blow; prepare thy sorrow for a younger corpse. Woe is me! is it a child’s life death robs me of? They live; but, cruellest news of all for thee, their mother is no more. What! my wife dead? By what cruel mischance? About her neck she tied the hangman’s knot. Had grief so chilled her blood? or what had befallen her? I know but this, for I am myself but now arrived at the house to mourn thy sorrows, O Theseus. Woe is me! why have I crowned my head with woven garlands, when misfortune greets my embassage? Unbolt the doors, servants, loose their fastenings, that I may see the piteous sight, my wife, whose death is death to me. Woe! woe is thee for thy piteous lot! thou hast done thyself a hurt deep enough to overthrow this family. Ah! ah! the daring of it! done to death by violence and unnatural means, the desperate effort of thy own poor hand!  Who cast the shadow o’er thy life, poor lady? Ah me, my cruel lot! sorrow hath done her worst on me. O fortune, how heavily hast thou set thy foot on me and on my house, by fiendish hands inflicting an unexpected stain? Nay, ’tis complete effacement of my life, making it impossible; for I see, alas! so wide an ocean of grief that I can never swim to shore again, nor breast the tide of this calamity. How shall I speak of thee, my poor wife, what tale of direst suffering tell? Thou art vanished like a bird from the covert of my hand, taking one headlong leap from me to Hades’ halls. Alas, and woe! this is a bitter, bitter sight! This must be a judgment sent by God for the sins of an ancestor, which from some far source I am bringing on myself. My prince, ’tis not to thee alone such sorrows come; thou hast lost a noble wife, but so have many others. Fain would I go hide me ’neath earth’s blackest depth, to dwell in darkness with the dead in misery, now that I am reft of thy dear presence! for thou hast slain me than thyself e’en more. Who can tell me what caused the fatal stroke that reached thy heart, dear wife? Will no one tell me what befell? doth my palace all in vain give shelter to a herd of menials? Woe, woe for thee, my wife! sorrows Gone ’neath the sun’s bright eye or night’s star-lit radiance. Poor house, what sorrows are thy portion now! My eyes are wet with streams of tears to see thy fate; but the sequel to this tragedy has long with terror filled me. Ha! what means this letter? clasped in her dear hand it hath some strange tale to tell. Hath she, poor lady, as a last request, written her bidding as to my marriage and her children? Take heart, poor ghost; no wife henceforth shall wed thy Theseus or invade his house. Ah! how yon seal of my dead wife stamped with her golden ring affects my sight! Come, I will unfold the sealed packet and read her letter’s message to me. Woe unto us! Here is yet another evil in the train by heaven sent. Looking to what has happened, I should count my lot in life no longer worth one’s while to gain. alas! is ruined, brought to naught, I say. O horror! woe on woe! and still they come, too deep for words, too heavy to bear. Ah me! What is it? speak, if I may share in it. This letter loudly tells a hideous tale! where can I escape my load of woe? For I am ruined and undone, so awful are the words I find here written clear as if she cried them to me; woe is me! Alas! thy words declare themselves the harbingers of woe. I can no longer keep the cursed tale within the portal of my lips, cruel though its utterance be. Ah me! Hippolytus hath dared by brutal force to violate my honour, recking naught of Zeus, whose awful eye is over all. O father Poseidon, once didst thou promise to fulfil three prayers of mine ; answer one of these and slay my son, let him not escape this single day, if the prayers thou gavest me were indeed with issue fraught. O king, I do conjure thee, call back that prayer; hereafter thou wilt know thy error. Hear, I pray. Impossible! Moreover I will banish him from this land, and by one of two fates shall he be struck down; either Poseidon, out of respect to my prayer, will cast his dead body into the house of Hades; or exiled from this land, a wanderer to some foreign shore, shall he eke out a life of misery. Lo! where himself doth come, thy son Hippolytus, in good time; dismiss thy hurtful rage, King Theseus, and bethink thee what is best for thy family. I heard thy voice, father, and hasted to come hither; yet know I not the cause of thy present Ha! what is this? thy wife a corpse I see; this is passing strange; ’twas but now I left her; a moment since she looked upon the light. How came she thus? the manner of her death? this would I learn of thee, father. Art dumb? silence availeth not in trouble; nay, for the heart that fain would know all must show its curiosity even in sorrow’s hour. Be sure it is not right, father, to hide misfortunes from those who love, ay, more than love thee. O ye sons of men, victims of a thousand idle errors, a way to teach them wisdom whose souls are void of sense? A very master in his craft the man, who can force fools to be wise! But these ill-timed subtleties of thine, father, make me fear thy tongue is running riot through trouble. Fie upon thee! man needs should have some certain test set up to try his friends, some touchstone of their hearts, to know each friend whether he be true or false; all men should have two voices, one the voice of honesty, expediency’s the other, so would honesty confute its knavish opposite, and then we could not be deceived. Say, hath some friend been slandering me and hath he still thine ear? am I, though guiltless, banned? I am amazed indeed; thy random, frantic words fill me with wild alarm. O the mind of mortal man! to what lengths will it proceed? What limit will its bold assurance have? for if it goes on growing as man’s life advances, and each successor outdo the man before him in villainy, the gods will have to add another sphere unto the world, which shall take in the knaves and villains. Behold this man; he, my own son, hath outraged mine honour, his guilt most clearly proved by my dead wife. Now, since thou hast dared this loathly crime, come, look thy father in the face. Art thou the man who dost with gods consort, as one above the vulgar herd? art thou the chaste and sinless saint? Thy boasts will never persuade me to be guilty of attributing ignorance to gods. Go then, vaunt thyself, and drive1 seeing thou now art caught. Let all beware, I say, of such hypocrites! who hunt their prey with fine words, and all the while are scheming villainy. She is dead; dost think that this will save thee? Why this convicts thee more than all, abandoned wretch! What oaths, what pleas can outweigh this letter, so that thou shouldst ’scape thy doom? Thou wilt assert she hated thee, that ’twixt the bastard and the true-born child nature has herself put war; it seems then by thy showing she made a sorry bargain with her life, if to gratify her hate of thee she lost what most she prized. ’Tis said, no doubt, that frailty finds no place in man but is innate in woman; my experience is, young men are no more secure than women, whenso the Queen of Love excites a youthful breast; although their sex comes in to help them. nor in the confines of my dominion. For if I am tamely to submit to this treatment from such as thee, no more will Sinis, call me the miscreants’ scourge. I know not how to call happy any child of man; for that which was first has turned and now is last. Father, thy wrath and the tension of thy mind are terrible; yet this charge, specious though its arguments appear, becomes a calumny, if one lay it bare. Small skill Yet am I constrained under the present circumstances to break silence. And at the outset will I take the point which formed the basis of thy stealthy attack on me, designed to put me out of court unheard; dost see yon sun, this earth? These do not contain, for all thou dost deny it, chastity surpassing mine. To reverence God I count the highest knowledge, and to adopt as friends not those who attempt injustice, but such as would blush to propose to their companions aught disgraceful or pleasure them by shameful services; to mock at friends is not my way, father, but I am still the same behind their backs as to their face. The very crime thou thinkest to catch me in, is just the one I am untainted with, for to this day have I kept me pure from women. Nor know I aught thereof, save what I hear or see in pictures, for I have no wish to look even on these, so pure my virgin soul. I grant my claim to chastity may not convince thee; well, ’tis then for thee to show the way I was corrupted. Did this woman exceed in beauty all her sex? Did I aspire to fill the husband’s place after thee and succeed to thy house? One thing I have not said, the Now by Zeus, the god of oaths, and by the earth, whereon we stand, I swear to thee I never did lay hand upon thy wife nor would have wished to, or have harboured such a thought Slay me, ye gods! rob me of name and honour, from home and city cast me forth, a wandering exile o’er the earth! nor sea nor land receive my bones when I am dead, if I am such a miscreant! I cannot say if she through fear destroyed herself, for more than this am I forbid. With her discretion took the place of chastity, while I, though chaste, was not discreet in using this virtue. Thy oath by heaven, strong security, sufficiently refutes the charge. A wizard or magician must the fellow be, to think he can first flout me, his father, then by coolness master my resolve. Father, thy part in this doth fill me with amaze; wert thou my son and I thy sire, by heaven! I would have slain, not let thee off with banishment, hadst thou presumed to violate my honour. A just remark! yet shalt thou not die by the sentence thine own lips pronounce upon thyself; for death, Oh! what wilt thou do? Wilt thou banish me, without so much as waiting for Time’s evidence on my case? Ay, beyond the sea, beyond the bounds of Atlas, if I could, so deeply do I hate thee. What! banish me untried, without even testing my oath, the pledge I offer, or the voice of seers? This letter here, though it bears no seers’ signs, arraigns thy pledges; as for birds that fly o’er our heads, a long farewell to them.  Fie upon thee! that solemn air of thine is more than I can bear. Begone from thy native land forthwith! Whither shall I turn? Ah me! whose friendly house will take me in, an exile on so grave a charge? Seek one who loves to entertain as guests and partners in his crimes corrupters of men’s wives. Ah me! this wounds my heart and brings me nigh to tears to think that I should appear so vile, and thou believe me so. Thy tears and forethought had been more in season when thou didst presume to outrage thy father’s wife. O house, I would thou couldst speak for me and witness if I am so vile! Dost fly to speechless witnesses? This deed, though it speaketh not, proves thy guilt clearly. Alas! Would I could stand and face myself, so should I weep to see the sorrows I endure. Ay, ’tis thy character to honour thyself far more than reverence thy parents, as thou shouldst. Unhappy mother! son of sorrow! Heaven keep all friends of mine from bastard birth! Ho! servants, drag him hence! You heard my proclamation long ago condemning him to exile. Whoso of them doth lay a hand on me shall rue it; thyself expel me, if thy spirit move thee, from the land. I will, unless my word thou straight obey; no pity for thy exile steals into my heart. The sentence then, it seems, is passed. Ah, misery I How well I know the truth herein, but know no way to tell it! O daughter of Latona, dearest to me of all deities, partner, comrade in the chase, far from glorious Athens must I fly. Farewell, city and land of Erechtheus; farewell, Troezen, most joyous home wherein to pass the spring of life; ’tis my last sight of thee, farewell! Come, my comrades in this land, young like me, greet me kindly and escort me forth, for never will ye behold a purer soul, for all my father’s doubts. In very deed the thoughts I have about the gods, whenso they come into my mind, do much to soothe its grief, but though I cherish secret hopes of some great guiding will, yet am I at fault when I survey the fate and doings of the sons of men; change succeeds to change, and man’s life veers and shifts in endless restlessness. Fortune grant me this, I pray, at heaven’s hand,—a happy lot in life and a soul from sorrow free; opinions let me hold not too precise nor yet too hollow; but, lightly changing my habits to each morrow as it comes, may I thus attain a life of bliss! For now no more is my mind free from doubts, unlooked-for sights greet my vision; for lo! I see the morning star of Athens, eye of Hellas, driven by his father’s fury to another land. Mourn, ye sands of my native shores, ye oak-groves on the hills, where with his fleet hounds he would hunt the quarry attending on Dictynna, awful queen. No more will he mount his car drawn by Venetian steeds, filling the course round Limna with the prancing that never slept beneath his lute-strings; no hand will crown the spots where rests the maiden Latona ’mid the boskage deep; nor evermore shall our virgins vie to win thy love, now thou art banished; while I with tears at thy unhappy fate shall endure a lot all undeserved. Ah! hapless mother, in vain didst thou bring forth, it seems. I am angered with the gods; out upon them! O ye linked Graces, why are ye sending from his native land this poor youth, a guiltless sufferer, far from his home? But lo! I see a servant of Hippolytus hasting with troubled looks towards the palace. Ladies, ye know; is he within the palace here? Lo! himself approaches from the palace. Theseus, I am the bearer of troublous tidings to thee and all citizens who dwell in Athens or the bounds of Troezen. How now? hath some strange calamity overtaken these two neighbouring cities? In one brief word, Hippolytus is dead. ’Tis true one slender thread still links him to the light of life. Who slew him? Did some husband come to blows with him, one whose wife, like mine, had suffered brutal violence? He perished through those steeds that drew his chariot, and through the curses thou didst utter, praying to thy sire, the ocean-king, to slay thy son. Ye gods and king Poseidon, thou hast proved my parentage by hearkening to my prayer! Say how he perished; how fell the uplifted hand of Justice to smite the villain who dishonoured me? Hard by the wave-beat shore were we combing out his horses’ manes, weeping the while, for one had come to say that Hippolytus was harshly exiled by thee and nevermore would return to set foot in this land. Then came he, telling the same doleful tale to us upon the beach, and with him was a countless throng of friends who followed after. At length he stayed his lamentation and spake: Thereupon each one of us bestirred himself, and, ere a man could say ’twas done, we had the horses standing ready at our master’s side. Then he caught up the reins from the chariot-rail, first fitting his feet But first with outspread palms he called upon the gods, Therewith he seized the whip and lashed each horse in turn; while we, close by his chariot, near the reins, kept up with him along the road that leads direct to Argos and Epidaurus. And just as we were coming to a desert spot, a strip of sand beyond the borders of this country, sloping right to the Saronic gulf, there issued thence a deep rumbling sound, as it were an earthquake, a fearsome noise, and the horses reared their heads and pricked their ears, while we were filled with wild alarm to know whence came then swelling and frothing with a crest of foam, the sea discharged it toward the beach where stood the harnessed car, and in the moment that it broke, that mighty wall of waters, there issued from the wave a monstrous bull, whose bellowing filled the land with fearsome echoes, a sight too awful as it seemed to us who witnessed it. A panic seized the horses there and then, but our master, to horses’ ways quite used, gripped in both hands his reins, and tying them to his body pulled them backward as the sailor pulls his oar; but the horses gnashed the forged bits between their teeth and bore him wildly on, regardless of their master’s guiding hand or rein or jointed car. And oft as he would take the guiding rein and steer for softer ground, showed that bull in front to turn him back again, maddening his team with terror; but if in their frantic career they ran towards the rocks, he would draw nigh the chariot-rail, keeping up with them, until, suddenly dashing the wheel against a stone, he upset and wrecked the car; then was dire confusion, axle-boxes and linchpins springing into the air. While he, poor youth, entangled in the reins was dragged along, bound by a stubborn knot, his poor head dashed against the rocks, his flesh all torn, the while he cried out piteously, Now we, though much we longed to help, were left far behind. At last, I know not how, he broke loose from the shapely reins that bound him, a faint breath of life still in him; but the horses disappeared, and that portentous bull, among the rocky ground, I know not where. I am but a slave in thy house, ’tis true, O king, yet will I never believe so monstrous a charge against thy son’s Alas! new troubles come to plague us, nor is there any escape from fate and necessity. My hatred for him who hath thus suffered made me glad at thy tidings, yet from regard for the gods and him, because he is my son, I feel neither joy nor sorrow at his sufferings. But say, are we to bring the victim hither, or how are we to fulfil thy wishes? Bethink thee; if by me thou wilt be schooled, thou wilt not harshly treat thy son in his sad plight. Bring him hither, that when I see him face to face, who hath denied having polluted my wife’s honour, I may by words and heaven’s visitation convict him. Ah! Cypris, thine the hand that guides the stubborn hearts of gods and men; thine, and that attendant boy’s, who, with painted plumage gay, flutters round his victims on lightning wing. O’er the land and booming deep on golden pinion borne flits the god of Love, maddening the heart and beguiling the senses of all whom he attacks, savage whelps on mountains bred, ocean’s monsters, creatures of this sun-warmed earth, and man; thine, O Cypris, thine alone the sovereign power to rule them all. Hearken, I bid thee, noble son of Aegeus: lo! ’tis I Latona’s child, that speak, I, Artemis. Why, Theseus, to thy sorrow dost thou rejoice at these tidings, seeing that thou hast slain thy son most impiously, listening to a charge not clearly proved, but falsely sworn to by thy wife? though clearly has the curse therefrom upon thee fallen. Why dost thou not for very shame hide beneath the dark places of the earth, or change thy human life and soar on wings to escape this tribulation? ’Mongst men of honour thou hast now no share in life. Hearken, Theseus; I will put thy wretched case. Yet will it naught avail thee, if I do, but vex thy heart; still with this intent I came, to show thy son’s pure heart,—that he may die with honour,— as well the frenzy, and, in a sense, the nobleness of thy wife; for she was cruelly stung with a passion for thy son by that goddess whom all we, that joy in virgin purity, detest. And though she strove to conquer love by resolution, yet by no fault of hers she fell, thanks to her nurse’s strategy, who did reveal her malady unto thy son under oath. But he would none of her counsels, as indeed was right, nor yet, when thou didst revile him, would he break the oath he swore, from piety. She meantime, fearful of being found out, wrote a lying letter, destroying by guile thy son, but yet persuading thee. Woe is me! Doth my story wound thee, Theseus? Be still awhile; hear what follows, so wilt thou have more cause to groan. Dost remember those three prayers thy father granted thee, fraught with certain issue? ’Tis one of these thou hast misused, unnatural wretch, against thy son, instead of aiming it at an enemy. Thy sea-god sire, ’tis true, for all his kind intent, hath granted that boon he was compelled, by reason of his promise, to grant. But thou alike in his eyes and in mine hast shewn thy evil heart, in that thou hast forestalled all proof or voice prophetic, hast made no inquiry, nor taken time for consideration, but with undue haste cursed thy son even to the death. Perdition seize me! Queen revered! An awful deed was thine, but still even for this thou mayest obtain pardon; for it was Cypris that would have it so, sating the fury of her soul. For this is law amongst us gods; none of us will thwart his neighbour’s will, but ever we stand aloof. For be well assured, did I not fear Zeus, never would I have incurred the bitter shame of handing first thy ignorance absolves thee from its villainy, next thy wife, who is dead, was lavish in her use of convincing arguments to influence thy mind. On thee in chief this storm of woe hath burst, yet is it some grief to me as well; for when the righteous die, there is no joy in heaven, albeit we try to destroy the wicked, house and home. Lo! where he comes, this hapless youth, his fair young flesh and auburn locks most shamefully handled. Unhappy house! what twofold sorrow doth o’ertake its halls, through heaven’s ordinance! Ah! ah! woe is me! foully undone by an impious father’s impious imprecation! Undone, undone! woe is me! Through my head shoot fearful pains; my brain throbs convulsively. Stop, let me rest my worn-out frame.Oh, oh! Accursed steeds, that mine own hand did feed, ye have been my ruin and my death. O by the gods, good sirs, I beseech ye, softly touch my wounded limbs. Who stands there at my right side? Lift me tenderly; with slow and even step conduct a poor wretch cursed by his mistaken sire. Great Zeus, dost thou see this? Me thy reverent worshipper, me who left all men behind in purity, plunged thus into yawning Hades ’neath the earth, reft of life; in vain the toils I have endured through my piety towards mankind. Ah me! ah me! O the thrill of anguish shooting through me! Set me down, poor wretch I am; come Death to set me free! Kill me, end my sufferings. O for a sword two-edged to hack my flesh, and close this mortal life! Ill-fated curse of my father! the crimes of bloody kinsmen. now pass their boundaries and tarry not, and upon me are they come all guiltless as I am; ah! why? Alas, alas! what can I say? How from my life Poor sufferer! cruel the fate that links thee to it! Thy noble soul hath been thy ruin. Ah! the fragrance from my goddess wafted! Even in my agony I feel thee near and find relief; she is here in this very place, my goddess Artemis. She is, poor sufferer! the goddess thou hast loved the best. Dost see me, mistress mine? dost see my present suffering? I see thee, but mine eyes no tear may weep. Thou hast none now to lead the hunt or tend thy fane. None now; yet e’en in death I love thee still. None to groom thy steeds, or guard thy shrines. Twas Cypris, mistress of iniquity, devised this evil. Ah me! now know I the goddess who destroyed me. She was jealous of her slighted honour, vexed at thy chaste life. Ah! then I see her single hand hath struck down three of us. Thy sire and thee, and last thy father’s wife. My sire’s ill-luck as well as mine I mourn. He was deceived by a goddess’s design. Woe is thee, my father, in this sad mischance! My son, I am a ruined man; life has no joys for me. For this mistake I mourn thee rather than myself. O that I had died for thee, my son! Ah! those fatal gifts thy sire Poseidon gave. Would God these lips had never uttered that prayer! Why not? thou wouldst in any case have slain me in thy fury then. Yes; Heaven had perverted my power to think. O that the race of men could bring a curse upon the gods! Enough! for though thou pass to gloom beneath the earth, the wrath of Cypris shall not, at her will, fall on thee unrequited, because thou hadst a noble righteous soul. For I with mine own hand will with these unerring shafts avenge me on another, for thee shall maids unwed before their marriage cut off their hair, thy harvest through the long roll of time of countless bitter tears. Yea, and for ever shall the virgin choir hymn thy sad memory, nor shall Phaedra’s love for thee fall into oblivion and pass away unnoticed. But thou, O son of old Aegeus, take thy son in thine arms, draw him close to thee, for unwittingly thou slewest him, and men may well commit an error when gods put it in their way. And thee Hippolytus, I admonish; hate not thy sire, for in this death thou dost but meet thy destined fate. And now farewell! ’tis not for me to gaze upon the dead, or pollute my sight with death-scenes, and e’en now I see thee nigh that evil moment. Farewell, blest virgin queen! leave me now! How easily Ah me! the darkness is settling even now upon my eyes. Take me, father, in thy arms, lift me up. Woe is me, my son! what art thou doing to me thy hapless sire! I am a broken man; yes, I see the gates that close upon the dead. Canst leave me thus with murder on my soul! No, no; I set thee free from this bloodguiltiness. What sayest thou? dost absolve me from bloodshed? Artemis, the archer-queen, is my witness that I do. My own dear child, how generous dost thou show thyself to thy father! Pray to have children such as me bom in lawful wedlock. O that holy, noble soul of thine! Farewell, dear father! a long farewell to thee! O leave me not, my son; endure awhile. ’Tis finished, my endurance; I die, father; quickly cover my face with a mantle. O glorious Athens, realm of Pallas, what a splendid hero ye have lost! Ah me, ah me! How oft shall I remember thy evil work, O Cypris! On all our citizens hath come this universal sorrow, unforeseen. Now shall the copious tear gush forth, for sad news about great men takes more than usual hold upon the heart.  \n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Atlas, who bears upon his brazen back the pressure of the sky, ancient dwelling of the gods, begat Maia from a daughter of one of those gods, and she bare me Hermes to mighty Zeus, to be the servant of the powers divine. Lo! I am come to this land of there did Phoebus force his love on Creusa, daughter of Erechtheus, beneath the rock of Pallas, northward of bore the burden in her womb unto the end, and when her time came, she brought forth a child in the house and carried him away to the selfsame cave wherein the god declared his love to her, and she cradled him in the hollow of a rounded ark and cast him forth to die, observant of the custom of her ancestors and of earth-born Erichthonius, whom the daughter of Zeus gave into the charge of the daughters of Agraulus, after setting on either side, to keep him safe, a guard of serpents twain. Hence in that land among the Erechthidae ’tis a custom to protect their babes with charms of golden snakes. But ere she left the babe to die, the young mother tied about him her own broidered robe. And this is the request that Phoebus craves of me, for he is my brother, after opening the lid of the wicker cradle that the child might be seen. But just as the sun-god was starting forth to run his course, a priestess chanced to enter the god’s shrine; and when her eyes lit upon the tender babe she thought it strange that any Delphian maid should dare to cast her child of shame down at the temple of the god; wherefore her purpose was to remove him beyond the altar, but from pity she renounced her cruel thought, and the god to help his child did second her pity to save the babe from being cast out. So she took and brought him up, but she knew not that Phoebus was his sire nor of the mother that bare him, nor yet did the child know his parents. While yet he was a child, around the altar that fed him he would ramble at his play, but when he came to man’s estate, the Delphians made him treasurer of the god and steward of all his store, and found him true, and so until the present day he leads a holy life in the god’s temple. Meantime Creusa, mother of this youth, is wedded to Xuthus; and thus it came to pass; a war broke out ’twixt who dwell in the land of Euboea; and Xuthus took part therein and helped to end it, for which he received the hand of Creusa as his guerdon, he and Creusa still are childless; wherefore they are come to this oracle of Apollo in their desire for offspring. To this end is Loxias guiding their destiny nor hath it escaped his ken, as some suppose. For when Xuthus enters this shrine, the god will give him his own son and declare that Xuthus is the sire, that so the boy may come to his mother’s home and be acknowledged by Creusa, while the marriage of Loxias remains a secret and the child obtains his rights; and he shall cause him to be called Ion, founder of a realm in Asia, through all the breadth of with boughs of laurel. I greet him first of all the gods by his name Ion which he soon shall bear. Lo! the sun-god is e’en now turning towards the earth his chariot-car resplendent; before yon fire the stars retire to night’s mysterious gloom from forth the firmament; the peaks of Parnassus, where no man may set foot, are all ablaze and hail the car of day for mortal’s service. to Castalia’s gushing fount as silver clear, and, when ye have bathed you in its waters pure, enter the shrine; and keep your lips in holy silence that it may be well, careful to utter words of good omen amongst yourselves to those who wish to consult the oracle; while I with laurel-sprays and sacred wreaths and drops of water sprinkled o’er the floor will purify the entrance to the shrine of Phoebus, my task each day from childhood’s hour; and for here in Phoebus’ shrine, which nurtured me, I minister, an orphan, fatherless and motherless. Come, thou tender laurel-shoot, gathered from gardens divine to wait upon the glorious god, thou that sweepest clean the altar of Phoebus hard by his shrine, where holy founts, that ever gush with ceaseless flow, bedew the myrtle’s hallowed spray wherewith I cleanse the temple-floor the livelong day, so soon as the swift sun-god wings his flight on high, in my daily ministration. Hail Paean, prince of healing! blest, ah! doubly blest be thou, child of Latona! Fair the service that I render to thee, Phoebus, before thy house, honouring thy seat of prophecy; a glorious task I count it, to serve not mortal man but deathless gods; wherefore I never weary of performing holy services. Phoebus is to me as the father that begot me, for as such I praise the god that gives me food. My task is nearly done of sweeping with the laurel broom, so now from a golden ewer will I sprinkle o’er the ground water from Castalia’s gushing spring, scattering the liquid dew with hands from all defilement free. Oh may I never cease thus to serve Phoebus, or, if I do, may fortune smile upon me! Ha! they come, the feathered tribes, leaving their nests on Parnassus. I forbid ye to settle on the coping or enter the gilded dome. Thou herald of Zeus, that masterest the might of other birds with those talons of thine, once more shall my arrow o’ertake thee. Lo! another comes sailing towards the altar, a swan this save thee from the bow; so fly away, and settle at the Delian mere, for if thou wilt not hearken, thy blood shall choke the utterance of thy fair melody. Ha! what new bird comes now? Does it mean to lodge a nest of dry straw for its brood beneath the gables? Soon shall my twanging bow drive thee away. Dost not hear me? Away and rear thy young amid the streams of swirling Alpheus, or get thee to the woody Isthmian glen, that Phoebus’ offerings and his shrine may take no hurt. I am loth to slay ye, ye messengers to mortal man of messages from heaven; still must I serve Phoebus, to whose tasks I am devoted, nor will I cease to minister to those that give me food. It is not in holy only that there are courts of the gods with fine colonnades, and the worship of Apollo, guardian of highways; but here, too, at the shrine of Loxias, son of Latona, shines the lovely eye of day on faces twain. Just look at this! here is the son of Zeus killing with his scimitar of gold the watersnake of Lerna. Do look at him, my friend! Yes, I see. And close to him stands another with a blazing torch uplifted; who is he? Can this be the warrior Iolaus whose story is told on my broidery, who shares with the son of Zeus his labours and helps him in the moil? Oh! but look at this! a man mounted on a winged horse, killing a fire-breathing monster with three bodies. I am turning my eyes in every direction. Behold the rout of the giants carved on these walls of stone. Yes, yes, good friends, I am looking. Dost see her standing over Enceladus brandishing her shield with the Gorgon’s head? I see Pallas, my own goddess. Again, dost see the massy thunderbolt all aflame in the far-darting hands of Zeus? I do; ’tis blasting with its flame Mimas, that deadly foe. Bromius too, the god of revelry, is slaying another of the sons of Earth with his thyrsus of ivy, never meant for battle. Thou that art stationed by this fane, to thee I do address me, may we pass the threshold of these vaults, with our fair white feet? Nay, ye must not, stranger ladies. May I ask thee about something I have heard? What wouldst thou ask? Is it really true that the temple of Phoebus stands upon the centre of the world? Aye, there it stands with garlands decked and gorgeous all around. E'en so the legend saith. If ye have offered a sacrificial cake before the shrine and have aught ye wish to ask Phoebus, approach the altar; but enter not the inmost sanctuary, save ye have sacrificed sheep. I understand; but we have ho mind to trespass against the god’s law; the pictures here without will amuse us. Feast your eyes on all ye may. My mistress gave me leave to see these vaulted chambers. Whose handmaids do ye avow yourselves? The temple, where Pallas dwells, is the nursing-home of my lords. But lo! here is she of whom thou askest. Lady, whosoe’er thou art, I see thou art of noble birth, and thy bearing proves thy gentle breeding. For from his bearing one may mostly judge whether a man is nobly born. Yet am I much amazed to see thee close thine eyes in grief and with tears bedew thy noble face, when thou standest face to face with the holy oracle of Loxias. Why, lady, art thou thus disquieted? Here, where all others show their joy at sight of Phoebus’ sanctuary, thine eye is wet with tears. Most courteously, sir stranger, dost thou express surprise at these my tears; the sight of this temple of Apollo recalled to me a memory of long ago, and somehow my thoughts went wandering home, though I am here myself. Ah, hapless race of women! ah, ye reckless gods! What shall I say? to what standard shall we refer justice if through the injustice of our lords and masters we are brought to ruin? Why, lady, art thou thus cast down, past all finding out? ’Tis naught; I have shot my bolt; for what remains, I say no more, nor seek thou further to inquire. Who art thou and whence? who is the father that begat thee? by what name are we to call thee? Creusa is my name, the daughter of Erechtheus I; my native land is A glorious city thine, lady, a noble line of ancestry! with what reverence I behold thee! Thus far, no further goes my luck, good sir. Pray, is the current legend true— What is thy question? I fain would learn. Was thy father’s grandsire really sprung from Earth? Yes, Erichthonius was; but my high birth avails me not Is it true Athena reared him from the ground? Aye, and into maidens’ hands, though not his mother’s— Consigned him, did she? as ’tis wont to be set forth in painting. Yes, to the daughters of Cecrops, to keep him safe unseen. I have heard the maidens opened the ark wherein the goddess laid him. And so they died, dabbling with their blood the rocky cliff. Even so. But what of this next story? Is it true or groundless? What is thy question? Ask on, I have no calls upon my leisure. Did thy sire Erechtheus offer thy sisters as a sacrifice? For his country’s sake he did endure to slay the maids as victims. And how didst thou, alone of al thy sisters, escape? I was still a tender babe in my mother’s arms. Did the earth really open its mouth and swallow thy father? The sea-god smote and slew him with his trident. Is there a spot there called Macrae? Why ask that? what memories thou recallest! Doth the Pythian god with his flashing fire do honour to the place? Honour, yes! Honour, indeed! would I had never seen the spot! How now? dost thou abhor that which the god holds dear? No, no; but I and that cave are witnesses of a deed of shame. Lady, who is the Athenian lord that calls thee wife? No citizen of Who is he? he must have been one of noble birth. Xuthus, son of Aeolus, sprung from Zeus. And how did he, a stranger, win thee a native born? Hard by With a bounding line of waters in between, so I have heard. This did he sack, making common cause with Cecrops’ sons. Coming as an ally, maybe; he won thy hand for this? Yes, this was his dower of battle, the prize of his prowess. Art thou come to the oracle alone, or with thy lord? With him. But he is now visiting the cavern of Trophonius. As a spectator merely, or to consult the oracle? ’Tis his wish to hear the self-same answer from Trophonius and Phoebus too. Is it to seek earth’s produce or fruit of offspring that ye come? We are childless, though wedded these many years. Hast thou never been a mother? art thou wholly childless? Phoebus knows whether I am childless. Unhappy wife! how this doth mar thy fortune else so happy! But who art thou? how blest I count thy mother! Lady, I am called the servant of Apollo, and so I am. An offering of thy city, or sold to him by some master? Naught know I but this, that I am called the slave of Loxias. Then do i in my turn pity thee, sir stranger. Because I know not her that bare me, or him that begat me. Is thy home here in the temple, or hast thou a house to dwell in? The god’s whole temple is my house, wherever sleep o’ertakes me. Was it as a child or young man that thou earnest to the temple? Those who seem to know the truth, say I was but a babe. What Delphian maid, then, weaned thee? I never knew a mother’s breast. But she who brought me up— Who was she, unhappy youth? I see thy sufferings in my own. The priestess of Phoebus; I look oh her as my mother. Until thou earnest unto man’s estate, what nurture hadst thou? The altar fed me, and the bounty of each casual guest. Woe is thy mother, then, whoe’er she was! Maybe my birth was some poor woman’s wrong. Hast thou any store, for thy dress is costly enough? The god I serve gives me these robes to wear. Wert thou never eager to inquire into thy birth? Ah! yes, lady! but I have no clue at all to guide me. Alas! I know another woman who hath suffered as thy mother did. Who is she? If she would but help me in the task, how happy should I be! ’Tis she on whose account I have preceded my husband hither. What are thy wishes? be sure I will serve thee, lady. I would fain obtain a secret answer from Apollo’s oracle. Name it, then; the rest will I undertake for thee. Hear, then, this story. Yet am I ashamed. Thus wilt thou accomplish naught, for shame is a goddess slow to act. A friend of mine asserts that Phoebus lay with her. Phoebus with a mortal woman? Stranger lady, say not so. Yea, and she bare the god a child without her father’s knowledge. It cannot be; some man did wrong her, and she is ashamed of it. This she denieis herself; and she hath suffered further woe. How so, if she was wedded to a god? The babe she bare she did expose. Where is the child who was thus cast forth? is he yet alive? No man knoweth. That is the very thing I would ask the oracle. But if he be no more, how did he perish? She supposes that beasts devoured the hapless babe. What proof led her to form this opinion? She came to the place where she exposed him, but found him no longer there. Were any drops of blood upon the path? None, she says; and yet she ranged the ground to and fro. How long is it since the babe was destroyed? Thy age and his would measure out the self-same span, were he alive. Hath she given birth to no other child since then? The god doth wrong her, and wretched is she in having no child. But what if Phoebus privily removed her child, and is rearing it? Then is he acting unfairly in keeping to himself alone a joy he ought to share. Ah me! this misfortune sounds so like my own. Thee too, fair sir, thy poor mother misses, I am sure. Oh! call me not back to piteous thoughts I had forgotten. I am dumb; proceed with that which touches my inquiry. Dost know the one weak point in this thy story? ’Tis all weak in that poor lady’s case. How should the god declare that which he wishes hidden? He must, if here upon the tripod he sits for all He is ashamed of the deed; do not question him. Aye, but his victim has her sorrows too. There is none who will act as thy medium in this. For were Phoebus in his own temple proved a villain, he would justly wreak his vengeance on the man who expounded to thee his oracles; desist then, lady; we must not prophesy against the god’s will, for it would be the height of folly in us, were we to try and make the gods against their will declare reluctant truths either by sacrifice of sheep at their altars, or by omens from birds. For those answers we strive to extort from heaven, lady, are goods that bring no blessing on our getting; but what they freely offer, thereby we profit. Many are the chances that befall the many tribes of men, and diverse are their forms. But scarce one happy scene canst thou find in all the life of man. Ah! Phoebus, here as there, art thou unjust to that absent sufferer, whose cause I now am pleading. Thou didst not preserve thy child, as in duty bound, nor wilt thou, for all thy prophetic skill, answer his mother’s questioning, that, if he be no more, a mound may be raised o’er him, or, if he live, he may some day be restored to his mother’s eyes. In vain is this the home of oracles if the god prevents me from learning what I wish to ask. But lo! I see my noble lord, Xuthus, nigh at hand, returning 278 from the lair of Trophonius; say nothing, sir, to my husband of what I have told thee, lest I incur reproach for troubling about secrets, and the matter take a different turn to that which I sought to give it. For women stand towards men in a difficult position, and the virtuous from being mingled with the wicked amongst us are hated; such is our unhappy destiny. First to the god all hail! for he must receive the first-fruits of my salutation, and next all hail to thee, my wife! Has my delay in arriving caused thee alarm? By no means; but thou art come at an anxious time. Tell me what response thou bringest from Trophonius, touching our future hopes of mutual offspring. He deigned not to forestal the prophecies of Phoebus. This only did he say, that neither thou nor I should return unto our house childless from the shrine. Majestic mother of Phoebus, to our journey grant success, and may our previous dealings with thy son now find a better issue! It will be so; but who acts as the god’s spokesman here? I serve outside the shrine, others within, who stand near the tripod, even the noblest of the Delphians chosen by lot, sir stranger. ’Tis well; I have attained the utmost of my wishes. I will go within; for I am told that a victim has been slain in public before the temple for strangers, and to-day,—for it is a lucky day,—I would fain receive the god’s oracle. Do thou, my wife, take branches of laurel, and seated at the altars pray to the gods that I may carry home from Apollo’s shrine an answer that bodeth well for offspring. All this shall be. Now, at any rate, if Loxias would retrieve his former sins, e’en though he cannot be my friend Why doth this stranger lady hint dark reproaches against the god unceasingly, either out of affection for her on whose behalf she seeks the oracle, or maybe because she is hiding something needing secrecy? Yet what have I to do with the daughter of Erectheus? She is naught to me. No, I will go to the laver, and from golden ewers sprinkle the holy water. Yet must I warn Phoebus of what is happening to him; he ravishes a maid and proves unfaithful to her, and after secretly begetting a son leaves him to die. O! Phoebus, do not so, but as thou art supreme, follow in virtue’s track; for whosoever of mortal men transgresses, him the gods punish. How, then, can it be just that you should enact your laws for men, and yourselves incur the charge of breaking them? Now I will put this case, though it will never happen. Wert thou, wert Poseidon, and Zeus, the lord of heaven, to make atonement to mankind for every act of lawless love, ye would empty your temples in paying the fines for your misdeeds. For when ye pursue pleasure in preference to the claims of prudence, ye act unjustly; no longer is it fair to call men wicked, if we are imitating the evil deeds of gods, but rather those who give us such examples. On thee I call, Athena mine, at whose birth-throes no kindly goddess lent her aid, delivered as thou wert by Titan Prometheus from the forehead of Zeus. Come, O lady Victory, come to the Pythian shrine, winging thy way from the gilded chambers of Olympus to the city’s streets, where Phoebus at his altar on the centre of the world brings his oracles to pass beside the dance-encircled tripod; come, too, thou daughter of Latona, together come, ye virgin goddesses, fair sisters of Phoebus! And be this your prayer, fair maidens, that the ancient house of Erechtheus may obtain For this brings to man a settled source of all-surpassing bliss, even to such as see in their ancestral halls a splendid race of strong young parents blest with offspring, to inherit from their sires their wealth in due succession after other children; yea, for they are a defence in time of trouble, and add a charm to weal, affording to their fatherland a saving help in battle. Give me before the pomp of wealth or royal marriages the careful nurture of noble children. The childless life I do abhor, and him who thinks it good I blame; to a happy life amongst my children, blest with moderate wealth, may I hold fast. Ye haunts of Pan, and rocks hard by the grots of Macrae, where Agraulos’ daughters three trip it lightly o’er the green grass-lawns before the shrine of Pallas, to the music of the piper’s varied note, what time thou, Pan, art piping in those caves of thine, where a maiden once that had a child by Phoebus, unhappy mother! exposed her babe, forced issue of her woful wooing, for birds to tear and beasts to rend, a bloody banquet! Never have I seen it told in woven tale or legend that children born to gods by daughters of earth have any share in bliss. Attendant maids, that watch and wait your mistress here at the steps of the temple fragrant with incense, say, hath Xuthus already left the holy tripod and the sanctuary, or doth he still abide within to ask yet further of his childlessness? He is still in the temple, sir, nor hath he passed this threshold yet. But hark! I hear a footstep at the outlet of the door, and lo! thou mayst see my master this moment coming out. All hail! my son; that word suits well as my first greeting to thee. ’Tis well with me; do but restrain thyself, and then both of us will be happy. Give me thy hand to grasp, thy body to embrace. Art thou in thy senses, sir, or hath some spiteful god reft thee of them? I am in my senses, for I have found what I hold most dear, and am eager to show my love. Cease! touch me not, nor tear these garlands of the god! I will embrace thee, for I am not seizing what is not my own, but only finding my own that I love full well. Hands off! or thou shalt feel an arrow pierce thy ribs. Why dost thou shun me, now that thou findest in me thy nearest and dearest? I am not fond of schooling boors and crazy strangers. Kill me, burn me, if thou wilt; for, if thou dost, thou wilt be thy father’s murderer. Thou my father, indeed i Oh! is not news like this enough to make me laugh? Not so; my tale, as it proceeds, will prove to thee what I assert. Pray, what hast thou to tell me? That I am thy own father, and thou my very child. Who says so? Loxias, who gave thee nurture, though thou wert my son. Thou art thy own witness. Nay, I have learnt the answer of the god. Thou art mistaken in the dark riddle thou hast heard. It seems then I do not hear aright. What said Phoebus? That the man who met me— When and where? As I came forth from the god’s temple— Well! what should happen to him? Should be my own true son. Thy own true son, or a gift from others? A gift, but mine for all that. Am I the first that thou didst meet? I have met no other, my son. Whence came this piece of luck? To both of us alike it causes surprise. Ah I but who was my mother? I cannot tell. Did not Phoebus tell thee that? I was so pleased with this, I did not ask him that. I must have sprung from mother earth. The ground brings forth no children. How can I be thine? I know not; I refer it to the god. Come, let us try another theme. Better hold to this, my son. Didst thou e’er indulge in illicit amours? Yes, in the folly of youth. Ere thou didst win Erechtheus’ daughter? Never since. Could it be, then, thou didst beget me? The time coincides therewith. In that case, how came I hither? That puzzles me. After that long journey too? That, too, perplexes me. Didst thou in days gone by come to the Pythian rock? Yes, to join in the mystic rites of Bacchus. Didst thou lodge with one of the public hosts? With one who at Initiated thee? or what is it thou sayest? Among the frantic votaries of Bacchus. Wert thou sober, or in thy cups? I had indulged in the pleasures of the wine-cup. That is just the history of my birth. Fate hath discovered thee, my son. How came I to the temple? Maybe the maid exposed thee. I have escaped the shame of slavish birth. Acknowledge then thy father, my son. It is not right that I should mistrust the god. Thou art right there. What more can I desire— Thine eyes now open to the sights they should. Than from a son of Zeus to spring? Which is indeed thy lot. May I embrace the author of my being? Aye, put thy trust in the god. Hail to thee, father mine. With joy that title I accept. This day— Hath made me blest. Ah, mother dear! shall I ever see thee too? Now more than ever do I long to gaze upon thee, whoe’er thou art. But thou perhaps art dead, and I shall never have the chance. We share the good luck of thy house; but still I could have wished my mistress too, and Erechtheus’ line, had been blest with children. My son, albeit the god hath for thy discovery brought his oracle to a true issue, and united thee to me, while thou, too, hast found what most thou dost desire, till now unconscious of it; still, as touching this anxiety so proper in thee, I feel an equal yearning that thou, my child, mayst find thy mother, and I the wife that bare thee unto me. Maybe we shall discover this, if we leave it to time. But now be taunted with base origin and poverty to boot, because in one of these respects thou something lackest, but thou shalt be renowned alike for birth and wealth. Art silent? why dost fix thy eyes upon the ground? Thou art lost in thought, and by this sudden change from thy former cheerfulness, thou strikest thy father with dismay. Things assume a different form according as we see them before us, or far off. I am glad at what has happened, since I have found in thee a father; but hear me on some points which I am now deciding. and if I win my way to the highest place in the state, and seek to be some one, I shall be hated by those who have no influence, for superiority is galling; while ’mongst men of worth who could show their wisdom, but are silent, and take no interest in politics, I shall incur ridicule and be thought a fool for not keeping quiet in such a fault-finding city. Again, if I win a name amongst the men of mark who are engaged in politics, still more will jealous votes bar my progress; for thus, father, is it ever wont to be; they who have the city’s ear, and have already made their mark, are most bitter against all rivals. Again, if I, a stranger, come to a home that knows me not, and to that childless wife who before had will feel the bitterness of having to bear her fortune all alone,—how, I ask, shall I not fairly earn her hatred, when I take my stand beside thee; while she, still childless, sees thy dear pledge with bitter eyes; and then thou have to choose between deserting me and regarding her, or honouring me and utterly confounding thy home? How many a murder, and death by deadly drugs have wives devised for husbands! Besides, I pity that wife of thine, father, with her childless old age beginning; she little deserves to pine in barrenness, a daughter of a noble race. That princely state we fondly praise is pleasant to the eye; but yet in its mansions sorrow lurks; for who is happy, or by fortune blest, that has to live his life in fear of violence with many a sidelong glance? Rather would I live among the common folk, and taste their bliss, than be a tyrant who delights in making evil men his friends, and hates the good, in terror of his life. Perchance thou wilt tell me, with but moderate trouble; no villain ever drove me from my path, and that is a grievance hard to bear, to make room and give way to sorry knaves. My duty was to pray unto the gods, or with mortal men converse, a minister to their joys, not to their Sorrows. And I was ever dismissing one batch of guests, while another took their place, so that I was always welcome from the charm of novelty. That honesty which men must pray for, even against their will, custom and nature did conspire to plant in me in the sight of Phoebus. Now when I deem that I am better here than there, father. So let me live on here, for ’tis an equal charm to joy in high estate, or in a humble fortune find a pleasure. Well said! if only those I love find their happiness in thy statement of the case. Cease such idle talk, and learn to be happy; for on that spot where I discovered thee, my son, will I begin the rites, since I have chanced on the general banquet, open to all comers, and I will offer thy birth sacrifice which aforetime I left undone. And now will I bring thee to the banquet as my guest and rejoice thy heart, and take thee to the Athenian land as a visitor forsooth, not as my own son. For I will not grieve my wife in her childless sorrow by my good fortune. But in time will I seize a happy moment and prevail on her to let thee wield my sceptre o’er the realm. Thy name shall be Ion, in accordance with what happened, for that thou wert the first to cross my path as I came forth from Apollo’s sanctuary. Go, gather every friend thou hast, and with them make merry o’er the flesh of sacrifice, on the eve of thy departure from the town of Well, I will go; one thing my fortune lacks, for if I find not her that gave me birth, life is no life to me, my father; and, if I may make the prayer, Oh may that mother be a daughter of yet doth he find him-setf tongue-tied and debarred from open utterance. Weeping and lamentation and the beginning of while she is childless and forlorn. What was this oracle thou didst vouchsafe, prophetic son of Latona? Whence came this boy, thy foster-child who lingers in thy temple? who was his mother? I like not thy oracle; I fear there is some treachery. In terror I await the issue of this chance; for strange are these tidings and strange it is that the god declares them to me. There is guile connected with this waif’s fortune. All must allow that. Shall we, good friends, throw off disguise and tell our mistress this story about her husband in whom her all was centred and whose hopes, poor lady, she once shared? But now in misery is she plunged, while he enjoys the smiles of fortune; to hoary eld she drifteth fast, while he, her lord, pays no regard to his loved ones,—the wretch, who came an alien to her house to share great wealth and failed to guard her fortunes! Perdition catch this traitor to my lady! never may he succeed in offering to the gods upon their blazing altar a hallowed cake with flames that augur well! He shall know to his cost my regard for my mistress. Now are sire and new-found son bent on the approaching feast. Ho! ye peaks of Parnassus that rear your rocky heads to heaven, where Bacchus with uplifted torch of blazing pine bounds nimbly amid his bacchanals, that range by night! Never to my city come this boy! let him die and leave his young life as it dawns! For should our city fall on evil days, this bringing-in of strangers would supply it with a reason. Enough, enough for us Erechtheus’ line that erst held sway! Aged retainer of my father Erechtheus while yet he lived and saw the light of day, mount to the god’s prophetic shrine that thou mayst share my gladness, if haply Loxias, great king, vouchsafe an answer touching my hopes of offspring; for sweet it is to share with friends prosperity, and sweet likewise to see a friendly face if any ill betide,—which God forbid! As thou of yore didst tend my sire, so now, thy mistress though I am, I take his place in tending thee. Daughter, thy manners bear good witness still to thy noble lineage; thou hast never brought shame upon those ancestors of thine, the children of the soil. A hand, I prithee, to the shrine! a hand to lean upon!’Tis a steep path thither, truly; but lend thy aid to guide my steps and make me young again. Come follow then, and look where thou art treading. Behold! though my steps loiter, my thoughts take wings. Lean on thy staff as thou climbest this winding path. Even this staff is a blind guide when I myself can scarcely see. True, but do not yield through fatigue. Never willingly, but I am not master of that which is mine no more. Maidens mine, my trusty servants at the loom and web, declare to me how my lord hath fared as touching the question of offspring which brought us hither: for if ye give me good news, ye will cause joy to a mistress who will not prove faithless to her word. O fortune! This prelude to your speech is unlucky. Woe is me! Can it be that the oracles delivered to my master wound me at all? Enough! why have aught to do with that which brings down death? What means this piteous strain? wherefore this alarm? Are we to speak or keep silence? What shall we do? Speak; for thou hast somewhat to tell that touches me. Then speak I will, though twice to die were mine. O mistress mine! never shalt thou hold a babe within thy arms or clasp him to thy breast. Ah me! would I were dead! My daughter! O woe is me for my calamity! Mine is a heritage of suffering and woe that poisons life, good friends. Ah, my child, ’tis death to us! Ah me! ah me! grief drives its weapon through this heart of mine. Stay thy lamentations. Nay, but sorrow lodges here. Till we learn— Ah, what further news is there for me? Whether our master is in the same plight and shares thy misfortune, or thou art alone in thy misery. On him, old sir, Loxias hath bestowed a son, and he is enjoying his good fortune apart from her. Herein hast thou declared a further evil crowning all, a grief for me to mourn. The child of whom thou speakest—is he some woman’s destined babe, or did the god declare the fate of one already born? A youth already born and grown to man’s estate doth Phoebus give to him; for I was there myself. What sayest thou? nor tongue nor lip should speak the word thou tellest me. And me. But declare more clearly how this oracle is finding its fulfilment, and say who is the child. Whomso thy husband first should meet as he issued from the shrine, him the god gave him for his son. Ah me! my fate, it seems, has doomed me to a childless life, and all forlorn am I to dwell in ray halls, without an heir. To whom did the oracle refer? whom did our poor lady’s husband meet? how and where did he see him? Dear mistress mine, dost know that youth that was sweeping yonder shrine? He is that son. Oh! for wings to cleave the liquid air beyond the land of Dost know the name his father gave to him, or is that left as yet unsettled and unsaid? He called him Ion, because he was the first to cross his path. Who is his mother? That I cannot say. But,—to tell thee all I know, old sir,— her lord is gone, with furtive step, into the hallowed tent, there to offer on this child’s behalf such gifts and victims as are offered for a birth, and with his new-found son to celebrate the feast. Mistress mine, we are betrayed by thy husband, fellow-sufferers thou and I; ’tis a deep-laid plot to outrage us and drive us from Erechtheus’ halls. And this I say not from any hatred of thy lord but because I bear thee more love than him; for he, after coming as a stranger to thy city and thy home, and wedding thee, and of thy heritage taking full possession, has been detected in a secret marriage with another woman, by whom he hath children. His secret will I now disclose; when he found thee barren, he was not content to share with thee thy hard and thus begat a son, whom he sent abroad, giving him to some Delphian maid to nurse; and, to escape detection, the child was dedicated to the god and reared in his temple. But when he heard his boy was grown to manhood, he persuaded thee to come hither to inquire about thy childless state. And after this, ’twas not the god that lied, but thy husband, who long had been rearing the child, and he it was that wove this tissue of falsehood, intending, if he were detected, to refer it to the god, whereas if he escaped exposure, to repel all odium, he meant to vest the sovereignty in this son of his. Likewise he devised anew his name, coined to suit the circumstances, Ion, because, as he asserts, he met him on his way. Ah! how I ever hate the wicked who plot unrighteousness and then cunningly trick it out. Far rather would I have a virtuous friend of no great intellect than a knave of subtler wit. Of all thy wretched fate this will be the crowning sorrow, the bringing to thy house to be its lord some slave-girl’s child, whose mother is unknown, himself of no account. For this evil had been to itself confined, had he persuaded thee, pleading thy childlessness, to let him establish in the house some high-born mother’s son; or if this had displeased thee, he ought to have sought a daughter of Aeolus in marriage. Wherefore must thou now put thy woman’s wit to work; either take the dagger, or by guile or Myself too am ready to share this labour with thee, and to help destroy the child when I have made my way into the chamber where he is furnishing the feast, and so repaying my masters for my maintenance I am willing either to die or still behold the light of life. ’Tis but a single thing that brands the slave with shame— his name; in all else no upright slave is a whit worse than freeborn men. I too, beloved mistress, am ready to share thy fate, be it death or victory. Ah! my suffering soul! how am I to keep silence? Am I to disclose the secrets of my love and lose all claim to modesty? What is there to keep me back any longer? With whom have I to pit myself in virtue’s lists? Hath not my husband proved untrue? Home and children, both are torn from me; all hope is dead; I have not realized my wish to set the matter straight, by hushing up my former union and saying naught about my son of sorrow. No! by the starry seat of Zeus, by her whose home is on my rocks, and by the hallowed strand of Triton’s mere with brimming flood, I will no more conceal my love; for if I can lift that burden from my breast I shall rest easier. With tears my eyes are streaming and my heart is wrung with anguish for the treacherous counsels both of men and gods,—traitors they! as I will show, ungrateful traitors to their loves! O! thou who dost awake that tuneful lyre with seven strings till to its sweet note of music the lifeless pegs of wild ox-hom resound again, thou child of Latona, to yon 293 bright orb of thine will I publish thy reproach. Yes, I saw thee come, the glint of gold upon thy locks, as I was gathering in my folded robe the saffron blooms that blazed like flowers of gold; and by my lily wrist didst thou catch me and ledst me to the cavern’s bed, what time I cried aloud upon my mother’s name,—thou a god to mate with me in shameless wise to pleasure lady Cypris! Then to my sorrow I bore thee a son, whom, though anguish thrilled my mother’s breast, I cast upon that bed of thine, where thou didst join in woful wedlock this unhappy maid. Ah! woe is me! that poor babe I bare thee is now no more; winged fowls have tom and devoured him, but thou art gaily carolling unto thy lyre some song of joy. Hark! thou son of Latona, to thee I call, for that thou dispensest warnings; there at thy golden throne on earth’s centre planted will I proclaim a word into thy ear. O! thou wicked bridegroom who art bringing to my husband’s house an heir, though from him thou hast received no boon; while that child of thine and mine hath died unrecognized, a prey to carrion birds, his mother’s swaddling-clothes all lost. Delos hates thee now, thy bay-tree loves thee not, whose branches sprout beside the tufted palm, where in holy throes Latona, big with child by Zeus, gave birth to thee. Ah me! what store of sorrows is here disclosed, enough to draw a tear from every eye! Daughter, with pity am I filled as a gaze upon thy face; my reason leaves me; for just as I am striving to lighten my spirit of its sea of troubles, comes another wave astern and catches me by reason of thy words; for no sooner hadst thou uttered this tale of present troubles than thou didst turn aside into a fresh a track of other woes. What is it thou sayest? What charge against Apollo dost thou Old friend, although to meet thine eye, I am ashamed, yet will I tell thee. Full well I know how to lend my friends a generous sympathy. Then hearken; dost know a cave toward the north of Cecrops’ rock, that we call Macrae? I know it; there is the shrine of Pan, and his altar hard by. That was the scene of my dire conflict. What conflict? see how my tears start forth to meet thy words. Phoebus forced me to a woful marriage. Was it then this, my daughter, that I noticed myself? I know not; but I will tell thee if thou speak the truth. At the time thou wert mourning in secret some hidden complaint? Yes, ’twas then this trouble happened, which now I am declaring to thee. How then didst conceal thy union with Apollo? I bore a child; hear me patiently, old friend. Where? and who helped thy travail? or didst thou labour all alone? All alone, in the cave where I became a wife. Where is the child? that thou mayst cease thy childless state. Dead, old friend, to beasts exposed. Dead? did Apollo, evil god, no help afford? None; my boy is in the halls of Hades. Who then exposed him? surely not thyself. Myself, when ’neath the gloom of night I had wrapped him in my robe. Did no one share thy secret of the babe’s exposure? Ill-fortune and secrecy alone. How couldst thou in the cavern leave thy babe? Ah! how? but still I did, with many a word of pity uttered o’er him. Oh for thy hard heart! Oh for the god’s, more hard than thine! Hadst thou but seen the babe stretch forth his hands to me! To find thy mother’s breast, to nestle in thy arms? By being kept therefrom he suffered grievous wrong from me. How earnest thou to think of casting forth thy babe? Methought the god would save his own begotten child. Ah me! what storms assail thy family’s prosperity! Why weepest thou, old man, with head close-veiled? To see the sorrows of thy sire and thee. Such is our mortal life; naught abideth in one stay. Daughter, let us cease to dwell on themes of woe. What must I do? Misfortune leaves us helpless. Avenge thee on the god who first did injure thee. How can I, weak mortal as I am, outrun those mightier powers? Set fire to Apollo’s awful sanctuary. I am afraid; my present sorrows are enough for me. Then what thou canst, that dare—thy husband’s death. Nay, I do respect his former love in the days when he was good and true. At least, then, slay the boy who hath appeared to supplant thee. How can I? would it were possible! how I wish it were! Arm thy followers with daggers. I will about it; but where is the deed to be done? In the sacred tent, where he is feasting his friends. The murder will be too public, and slaves are poor support. Ah! thou art turning coward. Devise some scheme thyself. Well, I too have subtle plans that cannot fail. If both conditions they fulfil, I will assist thee. Hearken then; knowest thou the battle of the earth-born men? Surely; the fight at Phlegra waged by giants against the gods. There Earth brought Gorgon forth, dreadful prodigy. To aid her sons maybe, and cause the gods hard toil? Yea, and Pallas, daughter of Zeus, slew the monster. What savage form had it assumed? A breast-plate of vipers fenced its body. Is this the tale I heard in days of yore? That Athena wears its skin upon her corslet. Is it this that Pallas wears, called by men her aegis? This was the name it received, that day she came to do battle for the gods. How, daughter, can this harm thy enemies? Hast heard of Erichthonius, or no? of course thou hast. Him whom Earth produced, the founder of thy race? To him whilst yet a babe did Pallas give— Ha! what? thou hast something yet to add? Two drops of Gorgon’s blood. What power could they exert on the nature of a human creature? The one with death is fraught, the other cures disease. What held them when she tied them to the child’s body? With links of gold she fastened them; this to my sire did Erichthonius give. And at his death it came to thee? Yea, and here at my wrist I wear it. How works the spell of this double gift of Pallas? Each drop of gore which trickled from the hollow  vein— What purpose does it serve? what virtue does it carry? Wards off disease, and nourishes man’s life. What doth that second drop effect, of which thou madest mention? It kills, for it is venom from the Gorgon’s snakes. Dost thou carry this charm mixed in one phial, or separate? Separate; for good is no companion for evil. Daughter dear, thou art fully armed with all thou needest. By this must the boy die, and thou must do the deadly deed. How and where? thine it is to speak, and mine to dare and do. In That is not wisely said; I may object to thy plan as thou to mine. How so? Hast thou the same mistrust that I experience? Thou wilt get the credit of his death, although thou slay him not. True; men say stepdames are jealous of their husband’s children. Kill him here then, that so thou mayst deny the murder. Well, thus I do anticipate the pleasure. Yea, and thou wilt from thy husband keep the very secret he would keep from thee. Dost know then what to do? Take from my arm this golden bracelet, Athena’s gift, some ancient craftsman’s work, and seek the spot where my lord is offering secret sacrifice; then when their feasting is o’er and they are about to pour drink-offering to the gods, take this phial in thy robe and pour it into the young man’s goblet; Go thou within the house of our public hosts; I the while will set about my appointed task. On! aged foot, grow young again in action, for all that time saith no to thee. Go, aid thy mistress against her enemy, help slay ’Tis well to honour piety in the hour of fortune, but when thou wouldst harm thy foe, no law doth block thy path. Daughter of Demeter, goddess of highways, queen as thou art of haunting powers of darkness, oh! guide as well the hand that fills by day a cup of death, against those to whom my revered mistress is sending a philtre of the gore that dripped from hellish Gorgon’s severed head, yea, ’gainst him who would obtrude upon the halls of the Erechthidae. Never may alien, from alien stock, lord it o’er my city, no! none save noble Erechtheus’ sons! For if this deadly deed and my lady’s aims pass unfulfilled, and the right moment for her daring go by, and with it the hope which now sustains her, either will she seize the whetted knife or fasten the noose about her neck, and by ending one sorrow by another will go down to other phases of existence. For never will that daughter of a noble line, while life is hers, endure within the sunshine of her eyes the sight of alien rulers in her halls. I blush for that god of song, if this stranger is to witness the torch-dance, that heralds in the twentieth dawn, around Callichorus’ fair springs, a sleepless votary in midnight revels, what time the star-lit firmament of Zeus, the moon, and Nereus’ fifty daughters, that trip it lightly o’er the sea and the eternal rivers’ tides, join the dance in honour of the maiden with the crown of gold and her majestic mother; where this vagabond, by Phoebus favoured, thinks to reign, entering into other men’s hard toil. Look to it, all ye bards, who, in malicious strains, expose our amours and unholy bonds of lawless love; see how far our virtue surpasses man’s shows himself a heedless wight, denying to the mistress of his halls the lot of mutual offspring, and, paying all his court to some strange love, hath gotten him a bastard son. Ladies of another land, where may I find your mistress, daughter of Erechtheus? For I have searched each nook and corner of this town, and cannot find her. What news, my fellow-thrall? why that hurried gait? what tidings bringest thou? I am pursued; the rulers of this land are seeking her to stone her to death. Alas, what is thy tale? say not we are detected in our secret plot for murdering the boy? Thou hast guessed aright; nor wilt thou be the last to share the trouble. How was the hidden scheme laid bare? The god found means to master wrong with right, unwilling to see his shrine polluted. How so? I do conjure thee, tell us all. For if to die or yet to live be ours, ’twere sweeter so, when we know all. Soon as Xuthus, husband of Creusa, had left the god’s prophetic shrine, taking with him his new-found son, to hold the feast and sacrifice that he designed to offer to the gods, himself departed to the place where leaps the Bacchic flame, with blood of sacrifice to dew the double peaks of Dionysus for the son now offered to his gaze, and thus he spake, Therewith he took the heifers and went his way. Meantime his stripling son in solemn form set up with upright stays the tent, inclosed but not taking good heed to guard it ’gainst the blazing midday sun, nor less against his westering beams, the limit of his course; an oblong space of five score feet he meted out intending to invite all had brought unto the god from his Amazonian spoils. On them was broidered many a pictured scene, to wit, Heaven marshalling his host of stars upon the vaulted sky; there was the sun-god urging on his steeds toward his fiery goal, the bright star of evening at his heels. Night too in sable robes went hurrying by, drawn by a single pair, and the stars did bear her company. Across the zenith a Pleiad sailed, and Orion too with falchion dight was there; above was the bear making his tail to turn upon the golden pole. Up shot the moon’s full face, that parts the months in twain; there too the Hyades showed their unerring light to mariners; arid Dawn, that brings the morning back, was chasing the stars before her. Next on the sides he hung yet other tapestry; barbarian ships bearing down on the fleet of votary; and in the midst of the banquet-hall he set goblets of gold, while a herald hasted and invited to the feast all citizens who would come. Then, when the tent was full, they decked themselves with garlands and took their fill of the rich viands. Anon after they had put from them the pleasure of eating came an old was wasting as incense the liquid myrrh, and in his charge he took the golden beakers, setting himself unasked to this office. Now when they were come to the time for the flute-players and the general libation, cried out that aged servitor, that potent philtre which, men say, his mistress gave to him to end the young man’s days on earth; and no man knew of this; but just as he so lately found held in his hand the drink-offering, the others following suit, some servant there uttered a word of evil import; whereat the stripling, as one who had been reared within the shrine amid reputed seers, deemed this an omen and bade them fill a fresh goblet, but that first drink-offering to the god he poured upon the ground and bade all others do the like. And silence stole upon them; while we with water and Phoenician wine were filling high the sacred bowls. While thus we were busied, comes a flight of doves and settles in the tent, for these dwell fearlessly in the courts of Loxias. Soon as the guests had poured away the luscious juice, those thirsty birds did dip their beaks therein, drawing it up into their feathered throats. Now all the rest received no hurt from the god’s libation, but one that settled on the spot where the son newfound had poured his wine, no sooner had tasted thereof, strange unwonted cries; and all the feasters gathered there marvelled to see the bird’s cruel agony, for she lay writhing in the toils of death, and her red claws relaxed their hold. Forthwith the son, vouchsafed by oracles, bared his arm by casting off his cloak and stretched it out across the board crying So was he detected, and under strong constraint declared Creusa’s daring deed and all the trick of the poisoned draught. Forth rushed the young man, whom the oracle of Loxias to his sire assigned, taking with him the banqueters, and standing mid the Delphic nobles made harangue, So now is the whole city seeking her, who hath to her sorrow sped a hapless journey; for, coming to crave the boon of offspring from Phoebus, she hath lost her life and children too. Ah me! I see no way at all to turn death’s hand aside; all, all, ere this, is brought to light owing to that fatal draught of the wine-god’s juice mixed for death with drops of viper’s gore, quick to slay; detected is our offering to the dead; for me my life must end in woe, while death by stoning waits my mistress. How can I escape? Shall I take wings and fly away, or creep beneath the darksome caverns of the earth, striving to shun the doom of death by stoning? or shall I mount the car drawn by swiftest steeds, or embark upon a ship? No man may hide his guilt, save when some god of his own will steals him away. Ah! my My trusty maids, the men of death are on my track; the vote of Unhappy one! we know thy sad mischance, how thou art placed. Oh! whither can I fly? for scarce had I the start of my pursuers from the house in my race for life; ’tis by stealth alone that I have thus far escaped my foes. Where shouldst thou fly except to the altar? What good is that to me? To slay a suppliant is forbidden. Aye, but the law has given me over to death. Only if thou fall into their hands. Look! here they come, cruel champions of vengeance, eagerly brandishing their swords. Sit thee down upon the altar of burnt-offering! for if thou art slain there, thou wilt fix upon thy murderers the stain of bloodguiltiness; but we must bear our fortune. O father Cephissus, with the bull-shaped head, what a viper is this thy child, or dragon with fiery eyes that dart a murderous gleam, in whose heart is throned incarnate daring, noxious as those Gorgon drops of venom wherewith she sought to compass my death. Seize her, that the peaks of Parnassus may card the flowing tresses of her hair, for thence shall she be hurled headlong amid the rocks. My lucky star hath kept me from going to This altar shall not save thee, nor yet Apollo’s courts, for that pity thou implorest cries out more loudly for me and my mother, who, though absent in the flesh, is never in name far from me. Behold this cursed woman, see the web of trickery she hath woven! yet comes she cowering to Apollo’s altar, thinking to escape the punishment of her misdeeds. I warn thee not to slay me, both in my own name and in his at whose altar I am stationed. What hast thou to do with Phoebus? This body I devote unto that god to keep. And yet thou wert for poisoning his minister? But thou wert not Apollo’s any longer, but thy father’s. Nay, I was his son, that is, in absence of a real father. Thou wert so then; now ’tis I, not thou, who am Apollo’s. Well, thou art not guiltless now, whereas I was then. I sought to slay thee as an enemy to my house. And yet I never invaded thy country, sword in hand. Thou didst; and thou it was that wert casting a firebrand into the halls of Erechtheus. What sort of brand or flaming fire was it? Thou didst design to seize my home against my will, and make it thine. What! when my father offered me a kingdom of his getting. How had the sons of Aeolus any share in the realm of Pallas? Arms, not words, he brought to champion it. No mere ally could enter into an inheritance in my land. And was it then from fear of consequences that thou didst try to slay me? Yes, lest I should myself perish if thou wert spared. Doth thy childlessness make thee envious that my father found me? And thou, wilt thou rob the childless of her home? Had I then no share at all in my father’s heritage? All that his sword and shield had won was thine, and thine alone. Quit the altar and sanctuary built for gods. Go bid thy own mother, wherever she is, do that. Shalt thou escape all punishment, after trying to kill me? Not if thou choose to butcher me within this shrine. What joy can it give thee to be slain amid the sacred wreaths? There is one whom I shall grieve of those who have grieved me. Oh! ’tis passing strange how badly the deity hath enacted laws for mortal men, contrary to all sound judgment; for instance, they should ne’er have suffered impious men to sit at their altars, but should have driven them away; for it was nowise right that hands unclean should touch the altars of the gods, though the righteous deserved to find a refuge there from their oppressors, instead of good and bad alike having recourse to the same divine protection with equal success. Refrain thyself, my son; for I, the priestess of Phoebus, chosen from all the maids of Hail to thee, dear mother mine,—mother, though thou didst not give me birth. Yes, so have I ever been called, and the title causes me no regret. Hast heard how this woman plotted my death? I have; thou, too, art wrong because of thy harshness. Am I not to pay back murderers in their coin? Wives ever hate the children of a former marriage. As I hate step-dames for their evil treatment of me. Do not so; but leaving, as thou art, the shrine, and setting forth for thy country— What then wouldst thou advise me do? With clean hands seek Surely any man hath clean hands who slays his enemies. Do not thou do this; but take the counsel that I have for thee. Say on; whate’er thou say’st will be prompted by thy good will. Dost see this basket that I carry in my arms? An ancient ark with chaplets crowned. Herein I found thee long ago, a newborn babe. What sayest thou? there is novelty in the story thou art introducing. Yea, for I was keeping these relics a secret, but now I show them. How earnest thou to hide them on that day, now long ago, when thou didst find me? The god wished to have thee as his servant in his courts. Does he no longer wish it? How am I to know this? By declaring to thee thy sire, he dismisses thee from this land. Is it by his command thou keepest these relics, or why? Loxias put in my heart that day— What purpose? Oh! speak, finish thy story. To preserve what I had found until the present time. What weal or woe doth this import to me? Herein were laid the swaddling-clothes in which thou wert enwrapped. These relics thou art producing may help me to find my mother. Yes, for now the deity so wills it, though not before. Hail! thou day of visions blest to me! Take then the relics and seek thy mother diligently. thou wilt learn this for thyself; for the god’s sake I reared thee, my child, and now to thee do I entrust these relics, which he willed that I should take into my safe keeping, without being bidden; why he willed it I cannot tell thee. For no living soul wist that I had them in my possession, nor yet their hiding-place. And now farewell! as a mother might her child, so I greet thee. The starting-point of thy inquiry for thy mother must be this; first, was it a Delphian maid that gave birth to thee, and exposed thee in this temple; next, was it a daughter of Ah me! the tears stream from my eyes when I think of the day my mother bore me, as the fruit of her secret love, only to smuggle her babe away privily, without suckling it; nameless I led a servant’s life in the courts of the god. His service truly was kindly, yet was my fortune heavy; for just when I ought to have lain softly in a mother’s arms, tasting somewhat of the joys of life, was I deprived of a fond mother’s fostering care. Nor less is she a prey to sorrow that bare me, seeing she hath suffered the self-same pang in losing all the joy a son might bring. Now will I take and bear this ark unto the god as an offering, that herein I may discover naught that I would rather not. For if haply my mother proves to be some slave-girl, ’twere worse to find her out than let her rest in silence. O! Phoebus, to thy temple do I dedicate this ark. Yet why? this is to war against the god’s intention, who saved these tokens of my mother for my sake. I must undo the lid and bear the worst. For that which fate ordains, I may ne’er o’erstep. O! hallowed wreaths and fastenings, that have kept so safe these relics dear to me; why, ah! why were ye hidden from me? Behold the covering of this rounded ark! No signs of age are here, owing to some miracle; decay hath not touched these chaplets; and yet ’tis long enough since these were stored away. Ha! what unlooked-for sight is here? Peace, woman! now, as erst, thou art my enemy. Silence is not for me. Bid me not be still; for lo! I see the ark wherein I did expose thee, my child, in days gone by, whilst yet a tender babe Seize her; she is mad, springing thus from the shelter of the carved altar. Bind her arms. Kill! spare not! for I to thee will cleave, and to this ark, and all that is within it. Is not this monstrous? here am I laid claim to on a specious pretext. Nay, nay, but as a friend art thou by friends now found. I a friend of thine! and wouldst thou, then, have slain me privily? Thou art my child, if that is what a parent holds most dear. An end to thy web of falsehood! Right well will I convict thee. My child, that is my aim; God grant I reach it! Is this ark empty, or hath it aught within? Thy raiment wherein I exposed thee long ago. Wilt put a name thereto before thou see it? Unless I describe it, I offer to die. Say on; there is something strange in this thy confidence. Behold the robe my childish fingers wove. Describe it; maidens weave many a pattern. ’Tis not perfect, but a first lesson, as it were, in weaving. Describe its form; thou shalt not catch me thus. A Gorgon figures in the centre of the warp. Great Zeus! what fate is this that dogs my steps? ’Tis fringed with snakes like an aegis. Lo! ’tis the very robe; how true we find the voice of God! Ah! woven work that erst my virgin shuttle wrought. Is there aught beside, or stays thy lucky guessing here? There be serpents, too, with jaws of gold, an old-world symbol. Yes, to copy our ancestor Erichthonius. What is their object? what the use of these golden gauds? pray, tell. Necklaces for the new-born babe to wear, my child. Lo! here they lie. Yet would I know the third sign. About thy brow I bound an olive-wreath that day, plucked from the tree Athena first made grow on her own rock. If haply that is there, it hath not lost its verdure yet, but still is fresh, for it came from the stock that grows not old. Mother, dearest mother, with what rapture I behold thee, as on thy cheeks, that share my joy, I press my lips! My son, light that in thy mother’s eye outshinest yonder sun,— I know the god will pardon me,—in my arms I hold thee, whom I never hoped to find, for I thought thy home was in that nether world, among the ghosts with Queen Persephone. Ah, dear mother mine! within thy arms I rest, the dead now brought to light, and dead no more. Hail, thou broad expanse of bright blue sky! What words can I find to utter my joy aloud? Whence comes to me such unexpected rapture? To what do I owe this bliss? This is the last thing that ever would have occurred to me, mother, that I was thy child. With fear I tremble still. Dost thou doubt my reality? Far from me had I banished these hopes. Whence, O whence, lady, didst thou take my babe into thy arms? Who carried him to the courts of Loxias? ’Tis a miracle! Oh! may we for the rest of our career be happy, as we were hapless heretofore. In tears wert thou brought forth, my child, and with sorrow to thy mother didst thou leave her arms; but now I breathe again as I press my lips to thy cheek, in full enjoyment of happiness. Thy words express our mutual feelings. No more am I of son and heir bereft; my house is stablished and my country hath a prince; Erechtheus groweth young again; no longer is the house of the earth-born race plunged in gloom, but lifts its eyes unto the radiant sun. Mother mine, since my father too is here, let him share the joy I have brought to thee. My child, my child, what sayst thou? How is my sin finding me out! What meanest thou? Thou art of a different, for different stock. Alas for me! Am I a bastard, then, bom in thy maiden days? Nor nuptial torch nor dance, my child, ushered in my wedding and thy birth. O mother, mother! whence do I draw my base origin? Be witness she who slew the Gorgon, What meanest thou? She that on my native rocks makes the olive-clad hill her seat. Thy words to me are but as cunning riddles. I cannot read them. Hard by the rock with nightingales melodious, Phoebus, Why dost thou mention Phoebus? Forced on me his secret love. Say on; for thy story will crown me with fame and fortune. And as the tenth month came round I bore a child to Phoebus in secret. Oh! thy happy tidings, if thy story is true. And about thee as swaddling-clothes I fastened this my maiden work, the faulty efforts of my loom. But to my breast I never held thy lips, or suckled or washed thee with a mother’s care; but in a desert cave wert thou cast out to die, for taloned kites to rend and feast upon. An awful deed! O mother! Fear held me captive, and I cast thy life away, my child; I would, though loth, have slain thee too. Thou too wert all but slain by me most impiously. O the horror of all I suffered then! O the horror of what is to follow now! To and fro from bad to good we toss, though now the gale is shifting round. May it remain steady! the past brought sorrows enough; but now hath a fair breeze sprung up, my son, to waft us out of woe. Let no man ever deem a thing past hoping for, when he turns an eye towards what is happening now. O Fortune! who ere now hast changed the lot of countless mortals first to grief, and then to joy again, to what a goal my life had come, even to staining my hands with a mother’s blood and enduring sufferings ill-deserved! Ah well! may we not learn these truths daily in all that the bright sun embraces? O mother, in thee have I made a happy discovery, and from my point of view there is no fault to find with my birth; but what remains I fain would speak to thee apart. Come hither, for I would say a word in thine ear, and o’er these matters cast the veil of silence. Bethink thee, mother, carefully; didst thou make the fatal slip, that maidens will, as touching secret amours, and then upon the god wouldst foist the blame, in thy anxiety to escape the shame of my birth asserting that Phoebus is my sire, albeit the god was not the parent. Nay, by our queen of Victory, Athena, that fought by Zeus, in days gone by, high on his car against the earth-born giants I swear, no mortal is thy father, my son, but King Loxias himself who brought thee up. How then is it he gave his own child to another father, declaring that I was begotten of Xuthus? his own son on him; for friend might give to friend even his own son to rule his house. Mother mine, this thought disturbs my breast, as well it may, whether the god speaks truth or gives an idle oracle. Hear, then, my son, the thought that hath occurred to me; Loxias out of kindness is establishing thee in a noble family, for hadst thou been called the god’s son, thou hadst never inherited a father’s home and name. How couldst thou, when I strove to hide my marriage with him and would have slain thee privily? But he for thy interest is handing thee over to another father. Not thus lightly do I pursue the inquiry; nay, I will enter Apollo’s shrine and question him whether I am the child of a mortal sire or his own son. Ha! who is that hovering o’er the incense-smoking roof, and showing to our gaze a heavenly face, bright as the sun? Let us fly, mother, that we see not sights divine, unless haply it is right we should. Fly not! I am no foe ye seek to shun, but alike in ’Tis I, Pallas, after whom your land is named, that am here, by Apollo sent in headlong haste; for he thought not fit to appear before you twain, lest his coming might provoke reproaches for the past; but me he sends to proclaim to you his words, how that this is thy mother, and Apollo thy sire; while thyself he doth bestow, as seems him good, not indeed on him that begat thee, nay, but that he may bring thee to a house of high repute. For when this matter was brought to light, he devised a way of deliverance, fearing that thou wouldst be slain by thy mother’s wiles and she by thine. Now it was King Apollo’s wish to keep this matter secret awhile, and then in I bid you hearken; for such was my purpose in yoking my chariot-steeds. Do thou, Creusa, take this stripling and to Cecrops’ land set forth; and there upon the monarch’s throne establish him, for from Erechtheus’ stock is he sprung, and therefore hath a right to rule that land of mine. Through the Hopletes and Argades; and then the Aegicores, called after my aegis, shall form one tribe. And their children again shall in the time appointed found an island home amid the Cyclades and on the sea-coast, thereby strengthening my country; for they shall dwell upon the shores of two continents, of Europe and of Asia, on either side the strait; and in honour of Ion’s name shall they be called Ionians and win them high renown. From Xuthus too and thee I see a common stock arise; Dorus, whence the famous Dorian state will spring; and after him Achaeus in the land of Pelops; he shall lord it o’er the seaboard nigh to Rhium, and his folk, that bear his name, shall win the proud distinction of their leader’s title. Thus in all hath Apollo and did rear him, suffering him not to die. Now therefore hold thy peace as to this thy child’s real parentage, that Xuthus may delight in his fond fancy, and thou, lady, continue to enjoy thy blessing. So fare ye well! for to you I bring tidings of a happier fate after this respite from affliction. O Pallas, daughter of almighty Zeus, in full assurance will we accept thy words; for I am convinced of my parentage from Loxias and this lady; which even before was not incredible. To what I say give ear. My former blame of Phoebus now is turned to praise, because he now restores to me the babe whom erst he slighted. Now are these portals fair unto mine eyes and this oracle of the god, though before I hated them. With joy now I even cling to the knocker on the door and salute the gates. I commend thee for thy sudden change, and thy fair words about the god. ’Tis ever thus; Heaven’s justice may tarry awhile, yet comes it at the last in no wise weakened. My son, let us set out for home. Go; I will follow. A guide we well may prize. Aye, and one that holds our city dear. Go, sit thee down upon the throne of thy ancestors. ’Tis my heritage and I value it. All hail, Apollo, son of Zeus and Latona! ’Tis only right that he, whose house is sore beset with trouble, should reverence God and keep good heart; for at the last the righteous find their just reward, but the wicked, as their nature is, will never prosper.  \n",

Where Euripus rolls about its whirlpools in the frequent winds and twists the darkening waves, my father sacrificed me to Artemis for Helen’s sake, or so he thought, in the famous clefts of For there lord Agamemnon mustered his expedition of a thousand ships of But when he met with dreadful winds that would not let him sail, he went to burnt sacrifices, and Calchas had this to say: they took me from my mother, pretending a marriage with Achilles. I came to she settled me here in the land of the Taurians. A barbarian rules this land of barbarians: Thoas, who runs as quickly as the flight of birds, and so he received his name for his swiftness of foot. Artemis has made me the priestess in this temple. Here I begin the rites, which the goddess delights in, of a banquet noble in name only—I am silent as to the rest, for I fear the goddess— But others carry out the sacrifices, not to be spoken of, within the temple of the goddess. But the strange visions which the night brought with it, I will tell to the air, if that is any relief. I dreamed that I had left this land to live in One support of my father’s house was left, I thought, and it had yellow locks of hair waving from its capital, and took on human voice. In observance of the art of slaughtering strangers that I practice here, I gave it holy water as if it were about to die, while I wept. This is my interpretation of this dream: Orestes, whom I consecrated by my rites, is dead. For male children are the supports of the house; and those whom I purify with holy water die. are they not yet here? I will go inside this temple of the goddess where I live.  I am looking, and turning my eyes everywhere, in examination. Pylades, do you think this is the hall of the goddess, for which we set sail from Yes, Orestes; and you must think so too. And the altar, that drips with the slaughter of Hellenes? Its dedications of hair, at least, are red with blood. Do you see the spoils hanging from the very walls? Trophies of strangers that have been slain. But I must look all around and keep careful watch. O Phoebus, where have you again brought me into the snare, by your oracles, since I avenged my father’s blood by the murder of my mother, and was driven by successive Furies, a fugitive, away from the land, and completed many winding courses; and coming to you I asked how I might arrive at an end to whirling madness and my labors, which I have carried out, wandering all over And you told me to go to the boundaries of the Tauric land,  where Artemis, your sister, has an altar, and to take the statue of the goddess, which is said here to have fallen to this temple from heaven; and, taking it by craft of some stroke of luck, to complete the venture by giving it to the Athenian land—what was to come next was not spoken of—and if I did this, I would have rest from my labors. I have come here, obedient to your words, to an unknown, inhospitable land. I ask you, Pylades, for you are my accomplice in this task, what shall we do? You see that the surrounding walls are high; shall we ascend the steps leading up to the house? But how might we escape notice? Or loosening the bronze bars of the door with levers, of which we know nothing? If we are caught opening the gates and contriving an entrance, we shall die. No, but before we die, let us escape on the ship in which we sailed here. Flight is not to be endured, nor are we accustomed to it, and we must not bring reproach on the god’s oracle; let us leave the temple and hide in a cave which the black sea washes with its moisture—far from the ship, so that no one, seeing it, may tell the ruler, and then seize us by force. But when the eye of gloomy night comes on, then we must dare to take the polished statue from the shrine, by any means. See where between the triglyphs there is an empty space to let ourselves down. The brave endure their labors, the cowardly are worth nothing at all. Yes, we did not come on a long sea voyage only to undertake a return home before the end; but you have spoken wel, we must obey. We should go wherever we can hide and escape notice. For it will not be the god’s fault if his sacred oracle falls to the ground without effect. We must endure. Keep a holy silence, you who inhabit the double clashing rocks of the O daughter of Leto, Dictynna of the mountains, to your hall, to the golden walls of your temple with beautiful pillars, I, the servant of the holy key-holder, bend my holy virgin steps. For I have left the towers and walls of I have come. What is the news? What is troubling you? Why have you brought me, brought me to the shrine, you who are the daughter of Atreus’ son, master of a thousand ships and ten thousand soldiers, who came to the towers of Oh! My servants, how I am involved in mournful dirges, in laments unfit for the lyre, of a song that is not melodious, alas! alas! wailing for my family. Ruin has come to me; I am lamenting the life of my brother, such a vision I saw in my dreams, in the night whose darkness is now over. I am lost, lost! My father’s house is no more; alas for my vanished family, alas for the sufferings of I am about to pour over the back of the earth these libations and the bowl of the dead: streams of milk from mountain cows, and offerings of wine from Bacchus, and the labor of the tawny bees; these sacrifices are soothing to the dead.  O child of Agamemnon beneath the earth, I send these to you as one dead. Accept them; for I will not bring to your tomb my yellow hair or my tears. I live far indeed from your country and mine, where I am thought to lie, unhappily slaughtered. I will sing for you, my mistress, responsive songs and a barbarian cry of Asian hymns; this song, dear to the dead, Hades sings in laments, in chants—not songs of triumph. Alas for the house of the Atreidae; the light of their scepter, alas, of the ancestral house, is lost. Once they ruled as prosperous kings in One pain comes after another, to the house of the golden lamb. . . .  from that earlier time when the Tantalids were killed, punishment came to the house, and fate presses what you do not want upon you. From the beginning my fate was unhappy, from that first night of my mather’s marriage; from the beginning the Fates attendant on my birth directed a hard upbringing for me, wooed by Hellenes, the first-born  child in the home, whom the unhappy daughter of Leda, by my father’s fault, bore as a victim and a sacrifice not joyful, she brought me up as an offering. In the horse-drawn chariot, they set me as a bride on the sands of without marriage, or children, or city, or friends, not raising hymns to Hera at . . .  a bloody fate, not to be hymned by the lyre, of strangers who wail a piteous cry and weep piteous tears. And now I must forget these things, and lament my brother, killed in the holder of the scepter in Look, here comes a herdsman, who has left the shores of the sea to bring you some new message. Daughter of Agamemnon, and of Clytemnestra, hear a strange report from me. And what is amazing in your news? Two young men have come to this land, fleeing the dark Symplegades in their ship, an offering and sacrifice pleasing to the goddess Artemis. Be quick to prepare the purifications and the first offerings. What country are the strangers from? How are they dressed? They are Hellenes; I know this one thing, and nothing further. Can’t you tell me their names? Did you hear them? One was called Pylades by the other. What is the name of his companion? No one knows; we didn’t hear it. How did you see them? How did you come upon them and catch them? At the edge of the breakers of the And what do herdsmen have to do with the sea? We came to wash our cattle in the salt water. Go back to the earlier question, how did you take them, and in what way, for I want to know this. They have come after a long time; the altar of the goddess has not yet been reddened by streams of Hellene blood. When we were driving the cattle, that feed in the forest, into the sea that flows through the Symplegades, there was a broken cleft, hollowed by the constant surge of waves, shelter for those who hunt the purple-fish. Here one of the herdsmen saw two youths, and made a retreat on tip-toe. He said: Another, who was foolish and bold in his lawlessness, laughed at the prayers and asserted that ship-wrecked sailors were sitting on the cliff, in fear of our custom, having heard that we sacrifice strangers here. Most of us thought that he spoke well, and that we ought to hunt down the customary offerings to the goddess. At this moment, one of the strangers left the rock, and stood, shaking his head up and down and groaning, with hands trembling, wandering in madness; and like a hunter, he cried aloud: We could not see these shapes; but he alternated the sounds of sheep and howling of dogs . . .  to send forth the Furies’ imitations. Astonished, we cowered together and sat in silence; but he drew his sword and rushed like a lion into the midst of our cattle, striking their flanks with his iron sword and thrusting it into their sides, thinking in this way to ward off the Furies, so that the waves of the sea blossomed red with blood. And all of us, as we saw our herds falling and ravaged, took arms, blew our conch shells, and collected the neighbors; for we thought cowherds would make a poor fight of it against well-grown and young foreigners. After a long time, our numbers were complete. But the stranger fell down, his pulsing beat of madness gone, his chin dripping with foam; when we saw him, so conveniently fallen, each of us went to work, hurling and striking at him.  The other stranger wiped off the foam and tended his body, covering him with a finely-woven robe, looking out for the attacking blows, treating his friend kindly with his care. The stranger, now in his senses, started up from his fall and realized the surge of enemies close at hand and the present danger to them both, with a groan; we did not let up our attack with stones, pressing hard from all sides. Then we heard his dreadful exhortation: But when we saw our enemies brandishing their two swords, we fled and filled up the rocky glens. But while some would flee, others pressed on and attacked them; if they drove those back, the ones who had just given way struck them with stones again. But it was hard to believe; with so many hands, no one succeeded in hitting these offerings to the goddess. We got the better of them with difficulty; not by daring, but by surrounding them in a circle, with stones we took away their swords; they sank on their knees to the ground, in weariness. Then we brought them to the lord of this land. He saw them, and at once sent them to you, for purification and slaughter. You have prayed for such sacrificial victims as these strangers, lady; if you destroy them, You have told an amazing story about this madman, whoever he is, who has come from Very well. You go and bring the strangers here; the holy rites will be my concern. O my unhappy heart, you were gentle to strangers before, and always full of pity, measuring out tears for the sake of our common race, whenever Hellenes came into your hands. But now, after those dreams that have made me savage, thinking that Orestes is no longer alive, whoever comes here will find me harsh to them. This is true after all, my friends, I have realized: the unfortunate, when themselves doing badly, do not have kind thoughts towards those who are more unfortunate. But no breeze from Zeus ever came, or a boat, bringing Helen here, through the rocks of the Symplegedes—Helen who destroyed me, with Menelaus, so that I might avenge myself on them, setting an and my own father was the priest. Ah me!—I cannot forget those past evils—how often did I stroke my father’s cheek and, hanging on his knees, told him: because I was going to the house of Peleus; I put off many embraces to another time, thinking that I would come back again to My unhappy Orestes, if you are dead, what glories have you left, what achievements of a father! I blame the goddess’ subtleties; whichever mortal has engaged in murder, or has touched a woman in childbirth or a corpse, she drives from her altars, thinking him impure; but she herself delights in human sacrifices. It is not possible that Leto, the wife of Zeus, gave birth to such folly. I judge that the feast prepared by Tantalus for the gods is not to be believed, that they fed on the flesh of his son; and I think that the people here, who are themselves killers of men, ascribe to the goddess their sorry behavior. For I believe that no god is evil. Dark straits of the sea, dark, where the gadfly flying from crossed over the inhospitable wave . . .  taking the Asian land in exchange for of Eurotas, green with reeds, or the holy streams of Dirce, to come here, to come to the unsociable land, where, for the divine maiden, the blood of mortals stains the altars and columned temples? Did they sail the pine-wood oars with double beat of surge, over the waves of the sea, a chariot of a ship in breezes that move the linen sails, to increase the contest of wealth for their halls? For hope is sweet, and insatiable in mortals, to their hurt, for those who bear away the weight of wealth, wandering over the wave and crossing to barbarian cities, with one expectation. But thought of wealth comes at the wrong time for some, while for others it comes moderately. The rocks that rush together, the sleepless shores of Phineus—how did they cross them, running along the salty coast on Amphitrite’s surge, where the fifty daughters of Nereus . . . the circular choruses sing, with wind in the sails, the guiding rudder creaking under the stern, with southern breezes or by the blasts of the west wind, to the land of many birds, the white strand, Achilles’ lovely race-course, over the Would that, by my mistress’ prayers, Helen, Leda’s dear child, might happen to leave her throat cut by the hands of my mistress, and so pay her requital. But what a sweet message I should receive, if a sailor came from to put an end to my wretched slavery! For may I even in dreams be at home and in my ancestral city, the enjoyment of pleasant sleep, a grace we have in common with prosperity. But here come the two youths, with tightly bound hands, the new sacrifice for the goddess; silence, my friends. These first-fruits of approaching the temple; the herdman did not deliver a false message. Lady Artemis, if this city carries out the rites in a way pleasing to you, accept the victims, which the custom among us declares to be unholy. Enough; first, it will be my care to perform well the rites of the goddess. Unbind the strangers’ hands, so that, as holy victims, they may no longer be in chains. Then go into the temple and make ready what is necessary and customary at the present time.  and will be without a brother! Who knows where such fortunes will arrive? For all the gods’ affairs creep on in darkness, and no one knows evil . . . fate leads us on towards what we cannot know. Unhappy strangers, where have you come from? For you have sailed a long time to reach this land, and you will be away from your home a long time, in the world below. Why do you lament these things, and mourn for the evils about to come upon us, lady, whoever you are? I do not think the one who is about to die wise, if he wishes to conquer the fear of death by wailing, nor the one who laments when Hades is near and there is no hope of safety; for so he puts together two ills out of one, incurring a charge of folly and dying all the same; we must let fate alone. Do not grieve for us; for we are acquainted with the sacrifices here and we know them. Which of you is called by the name of Pylades? I want to know this first. That one, if you have any pleasure in the knowledge. Of what city of What would you gain by learning this, lady? Are you brothers, from one mother? By friendship, yes; we are not brothers by birth, lady. What name did your father give you? I might rightly be called Unfortunate. I do not ask that; ascribe that to fortune. If I die unnamed, I would not be mocked at. Why do you begrudge this? Are you so proud? You will sacrifice my body, not my name. Can you not say what city you are from? You are seeking nothing profitable, since I am going to die. What hinders you from doing me this favor? The famous By the gods, truly, stranger, were you born there? Yes, from Have you left your country as an exile, or by what fate? My flight is in some manner willed and unwilled. Could you then tell me something that I wish to know? It will be no great addition to my own misfortune. Indeed, I am so glad that you have come from I am not; but if you are, take pleasure in it. Perhaps you know Would that I did not, even seen in a dream! They say it is no more, lost to the spear. It is so; you have heard nothing that has not happened. Has Helen come back to Menelaus’ home? She has; it was an unfortunate arrival for one dear to me. And where is she? She deserves an ill turn from me also. She lives at Creature hated by I have also had some benefit from the marriage of that woman! Have the Achaeans returned, as reported? How you put everything together and ask me all at once! Before you die, I want to profit by your answers. Question me, since you desire this; I will tell you. Has a certain Calchas, a prophet, come back from He is dead, as the story goes in O goddess, how good that is! What about Odysseus? He has not yet returned, but is alive, they say. May he die and never achieve a return to his country! Do not pray against that man; all is misery for him. But is the son of Thetis the Nereid still alive? He is not; his marriage at Yes, for it was a cheat, as those who experienced it know. Who are you? How well you ask about I am from there; while still a child I was lost. Then rightly you desire to know what has happened there, lady. What about the general, who is said to be happy? Who? The one I knew was not happy. There was said to be a certain lord, Agamemnon, son of Atreus. I do not know; leave this subject, lady. No, by the gods, but tell me, stranger, to delight me. The wretched man is dead, and in addition he destroyed another. Dead? By what fate? I am unhappy! Why do you mourn for this? It doesn’t concern you, does it? I grieve for his former prosperity. Yes, for he was dreadfully murdered by a woman. O miserable the slayer . . . and the slain! Stop now, and do not ask further. Only this much, if the wife of the wretched man is alive. She is not; she was killed by the son that she bore. O house thrown into confusion! What was his intent? To avenge on her the death of his father. Ah! How well he exacted an evil justice! Though he is just, he does not have good fortune from the gods. Did Agamemnon leave any other children in his house? He left one virgin daughter, Electra. What else? Is there any report of the daughter who was sacrificed? None, except that she is dead and does not see the light. Unhappy girl, and also the father that killed her! As a thankless favor to an evil woman, she died. Does the dead father’s son live at He lives, the miserable one, both nowhere and everywhere. False dreams, farewell; after all, you were nothing. And those who are called wise divinities are not less false than winged dreams. These is much confusion, both in divine affairs and in human; but only this is a grief to the one who was not foolish, but trusted in the words of prophets and died—as he died to those that know. Ah! What about me, and my parents? Are they alive? Are they not? Who can say? Listen to me; I have come to a subject which means benefit both to you, strangers, and to me, by your efforts. A good action is especially so, if the same matter is pleasing to all. Would you, if I should save you, go to which a captive wrote for me in pity? He did not think my hand murderous, but that the victims of the goddess, who holds these things just, die under the law. For I have had no one to go back to being saved, would send my letter to one of my friends. But you—if, as it seems, you are not hostile to me, and you know But let him, since the city exacts it, be the offering to the goddess, separated from you. Stranger, you have spoken all well but this: to sacrifice him would be a heavy grief to me. I am the pilot of these misfortunes, he sailed with me for the sake of my troubles. For it is not right for me to do you a favor and get out of danger, on condition of his death. But let it happen this way: give him the letter and he will take it to to let anyone who wishes kill me. It is most shameful for anyone to save himself by hurling his friends’ affairs into catastrophe. That man is my friend, and I wish him to live, no less than myself. O brave spirit!  How you were born from some noble stock, and are rightly a friend to your friends! May that one of my relatives who is left be such as you! For I am not without a brother, strangers, except in so far as I do not see him. Since you wish it, I will send this man with the tablet, and you will die; a great eagerness for this seems to possess you. Who will sacrifice me and dare such a dreadful deed ? I will; for I hold the office of this goddess. It is not envied, lady, and not blessed. But I am dedicated to necessity, which must be kept. Do you yourself, a woman, sacrifice men with the sword? No; but I sprinkle the holy water around your hair. Who is the slayer? If I may ask this. That charge belongs to those within this temple. What sort of tomb will receive me, when I die? The sacred fire within and the wide hollow of a cave. Ah! Would that my sister’s hand might lay out my body! You have prayed in vain, unhappy youth, whoever you are; for she lives far from a barbarian land. Yet indeed, since you happen to be an of the tawny mountain bee. But I will go and bring the tablet from the temple of the goddess; take care not to bear me ill-will. Guard them, attendants, without chains. Perhaps I will send unexpected news to one of my friends, whom I especially love, in  mingled with blood, will soon take you into their care. This is not a case for pity, but farewell, strangers.  An unenviable fate indeed for a friend, when his friend is to die. O cruel mission! Ah, ah! You are destroyed! Alas, alas! Which is better? For still my mind disputes a double argument, shall I mourn for you or rather for you. By the gods, Pylades, do you feel the same thing I do? I do not know; I have no reply to your question. Who is the girl? How like a Hellene she questioned me about the labors in his wife and children!  This stranger is an You are not much ahead of me: I was about to say the same things you said, except this: all who move about in the world know what happens to kings. But I have arrived at another consideration. What is it? Share it with me so that you may know better. It is shameful for me to live when you are dead; I sailed together with you, and I ought to die together with you. For I will seem a coward and base in or I plotted your death, in the afflictions of your house, for the sake of your kingdom, since I married your sister and heiress. I fear these things and I am ashamed; and I must breathe my last with you, be slaughtered with you and consumed on the pyre; because I am your friend and I fear reproach. Hush! I must bear my own ills, and when the grief is single, I will not bear it double. What you call vile and infamous, would be mine, if I cause you, who have toiled with me, to die; for it is not a hardship for me, suffering as I do at the hands of the gods, to give up my life.  But you are prosperous, and you have a house that is pure, not afflicted, while mine is impious and unfortunate. If you are saved and get sons from my sister, whom I gave to you for wife, my name would remain and the whole house of my father would not be wiped out in childlessness. But go, and live, and dwell in my father’s house. And when you come to woman, at an altar, purified for death. Do not ever betray my sister, when you see how lonely is my father’s house that you have joined by marriage. And now farewell; I have found you the dearest of my friends, you who have hunted with me, grown up with me, and borne with me many miseries. Phoebus, though a prophet, has deceived me; creating his plot, he drove me far away from killed my mother, and myself perish in turn. You will have a tomb, and I will never betray your sister’s bed, unhappy youth, since I will hold you dearer when dead than when alive. But the prophecy of the god has not destroyed you yet; although you stand near to slaughter. Great misfortune can offer great reversals, when it is fated; it can indeed. Silence; the words of Phoebus are no benefit to me; here comes the woman out of the temple.  Here are the many folds of the tablet, strangers. Hear what I want in addition. No man is the same when he is in troubles and when he falls out of fear into courage. I am afraid that when the one who is going to take this tablet to What do you want, then? What are you perplexed about? Let him give me an oath that he will convey this letter to And will you give in return the same words to him? To do what, or refrain from doing? Tell me. To send him from this barbarous land alive. What you say is right; how else could he deliver it? Will the king agree to this? Yes. I will persuade the king, and I myself will put this man on the ship.   I will give this letter to your friends. And I will see you safely outside the dark rocks. What god do you do you swear by, as witness to your oath? Artemis, in whose temple I hold office. And I swear by the king of heaven, revered Zeus. But if you leave off your oath, and wrong me? May I not return. What about you, if you do not save me? May I never set foot in Now listen to a consideration we have passed over. But it will be something new, if it is good. Give me this exception: if the ship suffers and the tablet is lost with its cargo in the waves, and I rescue myself only, may this oath not hinder me. Do you know what I will do? For many attempts hit many targets. I will tell you what is written in the folds of this tablet for you to report to my friends. For this is secure: if you preserve the writing, itself, though silent, will speak its message; if the writing is lost in the sea, when you save yourself, you will save my words. You have spoken well, on behalf of the gods and me. Make clear to whom I must bring this letter in Report to Orestes, the son of Agamemnon: the one slain at Where is she? Has she come back from the dead?? The one you are looking at; don’t confuse me by your talk. Bring me to Take me away from the barbarian land and the sacrifices of the goddess, where I hold the office of killing foreigners. Pylades, what shall I say? Where have we found ourselves? Or I will be a curse to your house. Orestes?  O gods! Why do you invoke the gods in my affairs? No reason; finish your words; my thoughts were elsewhere. Perhaps, if I question you, I will not arrive at things I cannot believe. Tell him that Artemis saved me, by giving a deer in exchange for me; my father sacrificed it, thinking that he drove the sword sharply into me; and she settled me in this land. This is my letter, this is the writing in the tablet. You have bound me with an easy oath, and sworn very well. I will not take much time to carry out the oath I swore. See, Orestes, I bring you a tablet from your sister here, and give it to you. I do receive it, but first I will pass over the letter’s folds to take a joy that is not in words.  Stranger, you are wrongly defiling the attendant of the goddess, by putting your hands on her robe that should not be touched. My own sister, born from my father Agamemnon, do not turn away from me, when you hold your brother and thought you never would! You are my brother? Stop this talk!  He is well known in Unhappy girl, your brother is not there. But did Tyndareus’ daughter, the Spartan, give birth to you? Yes, and my father was Pelops’ grandson. What are you saying? Do you have some proof of this for me? I do; ask me something about our father’s home. Well, it is for you to speak, for me to learn. I will say first what I have heard from Electra. Do you know of the strife that was between Atreus and Thyestes? I have heard of it; the quarrel concerned a golden ram. Did you not weave these things in a fine-textured web? O dearest, you are bending your course near to my heart! And the image of the sun in the middle of the loom? I wove that shape also, in fine threads. And you received a ceremonial bath from your mother, for I know; for no happy marriage has taken that memory from me. What about this? You gave locks of your hair to be brought to your mother? As a memorial, in place of my body, in the tomb. What I myself have seen, I will say for proof: an old spear of Pelops, in my father’s house, which he brandished in his hand when he won Hippodamia, the maiden of O dearest, for you are my dearest, none other, I have you, Orestes, far from our country of And I have you, who were thought to be dead. Tears, and laments mixed with joy, fill your eyes and also mine. I left you still a baby, young in the arms of your nurse, young in the house. O my soul, you have been more fortunate than words can say. I have come upon things that are beyond wonder, far from speech. For the rest of time, may we be fortunate with each other! O my friends, I have found an extraordinary joy; I am afraid that he will fly from my hands into the air. O Cyclopean hearths; o my country, dear We are fortunate in our family, but in our circumstances, my sister, we were born to be unfortunate in life. I was unhappy, I know, when my wretched father put the sword to my throat. Alas! Though I was not present, I seem to see you there. O brother, when I was brought, not a bride, to the treacherous bed of Achilles; but beside the altar there were tears and wails. Alas for the libations there! I also mourned for the daring act of our father. Fatherless was the fate I received, fatherless. One thing comes from another, by divine fortune. Yes, if you had killed your brother, unhappy one! O wretched, in my dreadful daring! How dreadful were the things I endured, alas, my brother! By only a little you escaped an unholy death, slain by my hands. But how will these things end? What fortune will assist me? What way will I find to send you from this city, from slaughter, to your native before the sword draws near to your blood? This is your business, unhappy soul, to find out. On the dry land, not in a ship? But if you go on foot, through trackless paths and barbarian tribes, you will draw near to death. But through the dark rocks of the narrow passage is a long way for flight by ship. I am unhappy, unhappy! Who, either god or mortal or something unexpected, might accomplish a way that is no way, and reveal a release from troubles for the only two children of the house of Atreus? It is marvelous and surpasses a fable, this event that I myself have have seen and shall relate, not as hearsay. When friends come into the sight of friends, Orestes, it is reasonable to embrace; but we must leave off wailing and turn to other matters: how we shall get the glorious name of safety and leave the foreign land. For wise men take opportunities, and do not overstep their fate to get other pleasures. Well said; but I think fortune will take care of that with us; when one is eager, divine strength is likely to be greater.  She lives with this man, What country is he from, and who is his father? Strophius of He is related to me, by the daughter of Atreus? He is a cousin, and my only true friend. He was not born when my father tried to kill me. He was not; for Strophius was childless for some time. Welcome, husband of my sister! And also my savior, not only a relation. But how did you dare that dreadful deed with our mother? Let us be silent on that; I was avenging my father. What reason did she have to kill her husband? Let our mother’s affairs be; nor is it good for you to hear. I am silent; does Menelaus rules there; I am an exile from my country Our uncle has surely not maltreated our afflicted house, has he? No, but fear of the Furies drives me out of the land. That was the madness that they reported there on the shore? That was not the first time that I was seen to be wretched. I know; the goddesses were driving you for the sake of your mother. So as to put a bloody bit in my mouth. Why have you made a journey to this land? I have come at the commands of Phoebus’ oracles. To do what? Can you speak of it, or must you be silent? I will tell you; this is the beginning of my many troubles. When my mother’s evil deeds, that I cannot speak of, came into my hands, I was driven to flight by the Furies’ pursuit; then Loxias sent me to For there is a holy tribunal there, which Zeus once established for Ares, when his hands were stained with blood-pollution. I came there . . . at first, no host would willingly take me in, as one hated by the gods; then some who felt shame offered me a table apart, as a guest, themselves being under the same roof, and in silence they kept me from speaking, so that I might be apart from them in food and drink, and into each private cup they poured an equal measure of wine and had their delight. And I did not think it right to blame my hosts, but I grieved in silence and seemed not to know, while I sighed deeply, that I was the murderer of my mother. I hear that my misfortunes have become a festival at and the people of Pallas honor the cup that belongs to the Feast of Pitchers. When I came to the hill of Ares to stand my trial, I took one seat, and the eldest of the Furies took the other. I spoke and heard arguments on the murder of my mother, and Phoebus saved me by bearing witness; Pallas counted out equal votes for me; and I went away victorious in my ordeal of blood. Some of the Furies who sat there, persuaded by the judgment, marked out a holy place for themselves beside this very tribunal; but others were not persuaded by the law, and drove me always in vagabond courses until I came to the holy plain of Phoebus in turn. Stretched out before his shrine and fasting, I swore to break off my life and die there, if Phoebus, who had destroyed me, did not save me. And then Phoebus cried out a golden voice from the tripod, and sent me here, to get the image Zeus hurled down, and set it up in Athena’s land. But what he marked out for my safety you must help me with; for if we possess the statue of the goddess, I will be released from madness and will put you on my ship of many oars and establish you again in for so I perish and all the race of Pelops, unless we take the heavenly image of the goddess. A terrible anger from the gods has boiled up against the race of Tantalus and drives them through torments. Before you came here, I was eager to be in and save our house. But I worry about concealment from the goddess and the king, when he finds the stone pedestal empty of the statue. How will I escape death? What argument will I have? But if this one thing happens all together, that you take the statue and bear me away on your lovely ship, the venture is a noble one. If I am separated from this, I am lost, but you might settle your affairs well and have a safe return. Indeed, I do not shrink from it, not even if I must die to save you. No, for when a man dies and is gone from the home, he is longed for; but women are powerless. I would not be the murderer of you as well as my mother; her blood is enough; I would rather have an equal share of life or death, in common with you. I will bring you home, if I myself escape from here, or if I die, I will remain here with you. Listen to what I think: if Artemis were hostile to this, how could Loxias have prophesied that I would take the statue of the goddess to Pallas’ city . . . and see your face. Putting all these things together, I have hope of our return. But how may we live, and take what we want? For our return home suffers from this; but the will is present. Could we murder the king? A fearful suggestion, for foreigners to kill their host! But we must dare it, if it brings our safety. I could not; yet I approve your eagerness. What if you were to hide me secretly in the shrine? So that we might take advantage of the darkness and escape? Yes, for the night belongs to thieves, the light to truth. There are secred guards within, who will notice us. Alas, we are ruined! How can we be saved? I think I have a new stratagem. What is it? Let me know; share your thought. I will use your sorrows as my contrivance. Women are wonderfully good at devising crafty plans! I will say that you came from Make use of my troubles, if you gain by it. And that it is not right to sacrifice you to the goddess. With what reason? I have a suspicion. Because you are not pure; I will frighten what is sacred. How does this help us to seize the statue of the goddess? I shall want to purify you in the waves of the sea— The image that we have sailed for is still in the temple. I will say that I have washed that also, since you have touched it. Where? Do you mean the watery inlet of the sea? Where your ship is moored by its roped anchor. Will you or some other bear the image in your hands? I shall; it is holy for me alone to touch it. But Pylades here—how will he be assigned to our labor? His hands, it will be said, are stained like yours with blood-pollution. Will you do all this secretly from the king, or with his knowledge? I shall persuade him; I could not hide it from him. Well then, my ship, with its quick stroke of oars, is at hand. You must indeed take care of the rest, so that it goes well. We need only one thing more, that these women conceal our plans; you approach them and find persuasive words. A woman has power over pity. The rest, perhaps—. May all turn out well! My dearest friends, I look to you; I am in your hands, whether I am to succeed, or come to nothing and lose my country, and my dear brother and dearest sister. And first of all, I begin my speech with this: we are women, and have hearts naturally formed to love each other, and keep our common interests most secure. Be silent for us and assist us in our flight. It is good to have trustworthy speech. You see how one fortune holds us three, most dear to each other, either to return to our native land, or to die. If I am saved, I will bring you safe to by your knees, by all that is dearest to you in your home: father, mother, child, if you have children. What do you reply? Who agrees with us, or is not willing to do this—speak! For if you do not acquiesce in my words, both I and my unhappy brother must die. Have courage, dear mistress, only see to your safety; I will be silent on all that you have charged me with—great Zeus be my witness. Bless you for your words, may you be happy! It is your work now, and yours, for soon the ruler of this land will come, inquiring if the sacrifice of the strangers has been carried out. Lady Artemis, you who saved me from my father’s slaughtering hand by the clefts of prophetic voice will no longer be held true by mortals But leave this barbarian land for Halcyon bird, you that sing your fate as a lament beside the rocky ridges of the sea, a cry easily understood by the wise, that you are always chanting for your husband; I, wingless bird that I am, compare my laments with yours, in my longing for the festivals of and the well-grown laurel and the holy shoot of gray-green olive, Leto’s dear child, and the lake that rolls about its ripples, where the melodious swan serves the Muses. O streams of tears that fell onto my cheeks, when my city was destroyed and the enemy forced me to sail, by their oars, by their spears! Purchased by gold, I came to a barbarian home, where I serve Agamemnon’s daughter, the attendant maid of the deer-killing goddess, and the altars where no sheep are sacrificed; and I envy ruin that is wretched throughout, for when you are brought up in harsh necessity, you do not suffer. Misery changes; life is hard for mortals, when they are treated badly after happiness. And you, lady, the the wax-bound reed of the mountain god Pan, piping, will shout to the oars, and Phoebus the prophet, with the ring of his seven-stringed lyre, singing, will guide you well to the gleaming land of the Athenians. Leaving me here, you will go with splashing oars. In the breeze, the forestays of the ship that carries you swiftly will spread out over the front beyond the prow. May I come to the bright race-course, where the sun’s fire goes; over the chambers of my home, may I cease to flutter the wings on my back. May I take my stand in the dances of glorious marriages, where I stood as a maiden, twirling about in the dancing bands of other girls, away from my dear mother; rushing on to the contest of charms, the luxuriant strife of hair, I covered my cheeks with the multi-colored veil and shadowed them with the locks of my hair. Where is the gate-keeper of this temple, the woman of Are they glowing with fire in the holy sanctuary? Here she is, to tell you everything clearly, lord. Oh! Daughter of Agamemnon, why have you lifted up in your arms the statue of the goddess from its pedestal that must not be moved? Lord, stand there in the entrance! Iphigenia, what has happened in the temple? I spit out the pollution; What is this news in your introduction? Tell it clearly. The victims you caught for me are not pure, lord. What taught you this? Or are you only saying what you think? The image of the goddess turned back from its place. By itself, or did an earthquake turn it? By itself; it closed up its eyes. What was the reason? Was it the uncleanness of the strangers? That was the reason, and nothing else; for they have done dreadful things. What, have they killed one of the barbarians on the shore? They come with murder done at home. What murder? For I strongly want to know. They killed their mother together with their swords. Apollo! No barbarian would have dared this. They were driven in pursuit from all of Is it for this that you bring the statue outside? Yes, to the holy air, to remove it from slaughter. How did you know the blood-pollution of the strangers? I questioned them, because the image of the goddess had turned back. And yet they dangled a sweet lure for my heart. Reporting to you some charm of news from That Orestes, my only brother, is happy. So that you might save them, for the delight of their messages. And that my father is alive and doing well. But you turned to the goddess, with reason. Yes, for I hate all Tell me, what shall we do with the strangers? We must reverence the law as it stands. But the libations and your sword are not at work? First I want to wash them, with holy purification. In fountain waters, or the drops of the sea? The sea washes away all men’s evils. They would certainly be holier victims for the goddess. And in this way my plans would succeed better. Doesn’t the wave beat against this very temple? This requires solitude; and I shall do more. Then where you wish; I do not want to see what should not be seen. I must purify the image of the goddess also. Yes, if a stain from the matricide has fallen on it. For I would not have lifted it from its base otherwise. Your piety and forethought are correct. Do you know what to do for me now? It is for you to make it known. Put chains on the strangers. Where could they escape you?  And let them bring the strangers here. It will be so. And veil their faces with their robes. Before the light of the sun. And send some of your servants with me. These will attend you. And send someone to announce to the city— That what has happened? That all remain indoors. So that they do not come in contact with murder? Yes, for such things are polluted.  That no one come near the sight. You are taking good care of the city And of the friends to whom I owe the most. You mean this for me. . . . The whole city marvels at you, with reason. You stay here before the shrine of the goddess. What shall I do? Purify the house with fire. So that you may return to find it pure. When the strangers come outside— What must I do? Hold your robe over your eyes. So that I do not receive the pollution. If I seem to delay too long— What limit of the delay should I keep in mind? Do not wonder at it. Carry out the rites of the goddess well, since you have leisure. May this purification fall out as I wish! I pray along with you. I see the strangers coming out of the temple now, and the ornaments of the goddess and the new-born lambs, because I will wash blood-pollution away with blood, and the flash of torches and all the rest that I have set out as purification for the strangers and the goddess. I proclaim to the citizens to keep away from this pollution, if any guard of the temple is purifying his hands for the gods, or if anyone is coming to form a marriage alliance, or is weighted down by childbirth— begone, stand away, so that this defilement does not fall on anyone.  Lovely is the son of Leto, whom she, the Delian, once bore in the fruitful valleys, golden-haired, skilled at the lyre; and also the one who glories in her well-aimed arrows. For the mother, leaving the famous birth-place, brought him from the ridges of the sea to the heights of with brightly colored back, his scales of bronze in the leaf-shaded laurel, huge monster of the earth, guarded Earth’s prophetic shrine. You killed him, o Phoebus, while still a baby, still leaping in the arms of your dear mother, and you entered the holy shrine, and sit on the golden tripod, on your truthful throne distributing prophecies from the gods to mortals, up from the sanctuary, neighbor of Castalia’s streams, as you dwell in the middle of the earth. But when he came and sent Themis, the child of Earth, away from the holy oracle of and what will happen in the future, through dark beds of sleep on the ground; and so Earth took the office of prophecy away from Phoebus, in envy, because of her daughter. The lord made his swift way to and wound his baby hands around the throne of Zeus, to take the wrath of the earth goddess from the Pythian home. Zeus smiled, that the child so quickly came to ask for worship that pays in gold. He shook his locks of hair, to put an end to the night voices, and took away from mortals the truth that appears in darkness, and gave the privilege back again to Loxias, and to mortals confidence in the songs of prophecy at the throne visited by many men. O you that guard the temple and stand by the altar, where has Thoas, the lord of this land, gone? Open the well-fastened gates, and call forth from this shrine the ruler of the land. What is it, if I may speak when not commanded? The two young men are gone away, through the plots of Agamemnon’s daughter; they are escaping from this land, with the holy image deep within a Hellene ship. What you say is incredible; but the one you want to see, the lord of the country, has gone in haste from the temple. Where? For he should know what has been done. We don’t know; but go after him, and report these things to him where you find him. See, what a faithless race you women are! You also have a share in what has been done. You are mad! What do we have to do the the flight of the strangers? Go as quickly as you can to the ruler’s door! No! Not until this interpreter brings word if the king is inside or not. Ho there! Unbar the doors—I am speaking to those within— and inform the master that I am at the gate with a burden of bad news.  Ah! These women told me that you were outside; they would have driven me away from the temple, but you were inside after all. What advantage were they expecting and hunting after? I will tell you about them later; hear what is currently at hand. The girl who presided at this altar, Iphigenia, has left the country with the strangers, and takes with her the holy statue of the goddess; the purification was a cheat. What are you saying? What influence in her character brought her to this? To save Orestes; here is a marvel for you! To save whom? Clytemnestra’s son? The one whom the goddess was dedicating to herself at this altar. Marvelous! for what more can it be called? Do not think of that, but listen to me; consider it clearly and when you hear, devise a pursuit to hunt down the strangers. Speak; you have said well; for their flight is not so brief a voyage as to escape my spear. When we came to the sea-shore, where Orestes’ ship was moored in hiding, Agamemnon’s daughter motioned to those of us you sent with the strangers’ bonds to stand far off, as if her sacrifice of purifying flame, that she had come for, were secret. But she went on alone, holding the strangers’ chains in her hands, behind them. Your servants, lord, were suspicious, but we allowed it. After a while, so that we might think that she was accomplishing something, she raised a shout, and chanted strange songs and spells, as if she were washing off the pollution of murder. When we had sat a long time, it occurred to us that the strangers, loosed from their bonds, might kill her and escape by flight. But we were afraid of seeing what we ought not, and sat in silence. But at length we all resolved to go where they were, although we were not allowed. There we saw a Hellene ship, winged with ready blade for the stroke, and at the oar-locks were fifty rowers with their oars; the two youths stood by the stern, freed from their chains. Some were holding the prow in place with poles; others were fastening the anchor from the cat-heads; others were drawing the stern-cables through their hands, and making haste to let down the ladders into the sea for the strangers. Without sparing ourselves, when we saw their treacherous wiles, we seized the priestess and the cables, and tried to draw the ship’s rudder-oars out through their holes. Then there was a debate: But we held her no less, and were leading her to you by force, for which I received these dreadful blows on my cheeks; they had no swords, nor did we. Both the youths gave rattling blows with their fists, darting their limbs against our sides and breasts, so that as soon as we joined battle, we were worn out. We were fleeing to the cliff, stamped with dreadful marks, some with bloody wounds on their heads, others on their eyes; when we stood on the on the heights, we fought more cautiously and hurled rocks at them. But, standing on the stern, the archers with their arrows kept us off and drove us away. And now an immense swelling wave ran the ship aground, and the maiden was afraid to get her feet wet. Orestes bore his sister on his left arm, going into the sea and quickly up the ladder, and he set her on the ship, along with the statue of Zeus’ daughter, fallen from heaven. From the middle of the ship, he cried out: They gave a cheerful shout, and struck the salt wave. The ship, while it was within the harbor, was headed for the mouth; but when it had crossed, it met with a violent swell aand was hard pressed; and the wind, rising with sudden dreadful gusts, forced it astern. They beat the waves strongly; but the swell was driving the ship back towards the land. Agamemnon’s daughter stood up and prayed: to the oars, at the command. But the ship came nearer and nearer to the rocks; some of us rushed into the sea, others grasped the woven ropes. And I set out here to you at once, lord, to tell you what has happened there. But go, take chains and nets with you; for if the swell does not become calm, there is no hope of safety for the strangers. Revered Poseidon, ruler of the sea, watches over Unhappy Iphigenia, you will die with your brother, if you come again into the hands of the king. All citizens of this barbarian land, hurl the reins on your horses, rush to the coast and seize what the Hellene ship casts forth! With the goddess’ help, be eager to hunt down these impious men! Drag the swift ships to the sea! So that by sea and with pursuit on horseback by land, you may take them; and hurl their bodies from the hard rock, or impale them on the stake.  Where, where are you carrying this pursuit, lord Thoas? Listen the words of Athena, who is here. Cease to follow or to send an army pouring forth; for Orestes came here, destined by the oracles of Loxias, to flee from the anger of the Furies, and to bring his sister to now lets him sail over the back of the waveless sea. And you, Orestes, attend to my commands, for you hear the goddess’ voice even though not present: go away with the statue and your sister; and when you come to there is a place on the farthest borders of the Attic land, neighbor to the ridge of Carystia, sacred, and my people call it which you have endured, wandering through to a man’s throat and draw out blood, in atonement for your sacrifice, so that the goddess may have her honors, and holiness is revered. You, Iphigenia, must be key-holder for this goddess on the hallowed stairs of and they will dedicate adornment to you, finely-woven robes which women who have died in childbirth leave in their homes. I charge you to send these Hellene women to their country, for their correct intentions. . . . For I saved you before also, Orestes, on Ares’ hill when the votes were equal; and this will be the custom, for the one with equal votes to win. But, son of Agamemnon, take your sister away from this land. And you, Thoas, do not be angry. Lady Athena, whoever hears the words of the gods and does not obey, is not thinking rightly. I am not angry at Orestes, for going off with the goddess’ image, or at his sister; for what good is it to contend against the strength of gods? Let them go to your land with the statue of the goddess, and let them establish it there, with good fortune. I will send these women also to fortunate and the ships I raised against the strangers, as you think this right, goddess. I commend you; for necessity rules both you and the gods. Go, winds, carry the son of Agamemnon to Go with good fortune, blessed in having your portion of safety. Pallas Athena, holy among immortals and mortals, we will do as you command. For we receive your voice in our ears with great and unexpected pleasure. Greatly revered Victory, may you occupy my life and never cease to crown me!  \n",

                                                                          Leda, the daughter of Thestius, had three children, maidens, Phoebe, Clytemnestra my wife, and Helen; the foremost of the favored sons of Now the matter filled Tyndareus, her father, with perplexity, whether to give her or not, how he might best succeed. This thought occurred to him: the suitors should swear to each other and join right hands and pour libations with burnt-sacrifice, binding themselves by this curse: whoever wins the child of Tyndareus for wife, they will assist that man, in case a rival takes her from his house and goes his way, robbing her husband of his rights; and march against that man in armed array and raze his city to the ground, Hellene no less than barbarian. Now when they had once pledged their word and old Tyndareus with no small cleverness had beguiled them by his shrewd device, he allowed his daughter to choose from among her suitors the one towards whom Her choice fell on Menelaus; would she had never taken him! Then there came to and he, finding Menelaus gone from home, carried Helen off, in mutual desire, to his steading on Ida. Goaded to frenzy, Menelaus flew through And so the Hellenes, brandishing their spears and donning their harness, came here to the narrow straits of since I was his brother. Would that some other had gained that distinction instead of me! But after the army was gathered and come together, we still remained at and he answered that we should sacrifice my own child Iphigenia to Artemis, whose home is in this land, and we would sail and sack the Phrygians’ capital with loud proclamation to disband the whole army, as I could never bear to slay my daughter. Whereupon my brother, bringing every argument to bear, persuaded me at last to face the crime; so I wrote in a folded scroll and sent to my wife, bidding her despatch our daughter to me on the pretence of wedding Achilles, at the same time magnifying his exalted rank and saying that he refused to sail with the Achaeans, unless a bride of our lineage should go to Old man, come here and stand before my dwelling. I come; what new schemes now, king Agamemnon? Will you hurry? I am hurrying. It is little enough sleep old age allows me and keenly it watches over my eyes. What can that star be, steering its course there? Sirius, still shooting over the zenith on his way near the Pleiads’ sevenfold track. The birds are still at any rate and the sea is calm, hushed are the winds, and silence broods over the Euripus. Then why are you outside your tent, why so restless, my lord Agamemnon? All is yet quiet here in the watch on the walls is not yet astir. Let us go in. I envy you, old man, yes, and every man who leads a life secure, unknown and unrenowned; but little I envy those in office. And yet it is there that we place the be-all and end-all of existence. Yes, but that is where the danger comes; and ambition, upset our life, at another the numerous peevish fancies of our subjects shatter it. I do not like these sentiments in one who is a chief. It was not to enjoy all blessings that Atreus begot you, Agamemnon; but you must experience joy and sorrow alike, mortal as you are. Even though you like it not, this is what the gods decree. But you, after letting your taper spread its light abroad, write the letter which is still in your hands and then erase the same words again, sealing and reopening the tablet, then flinging it to the ground with floods of tears, and leaving nothing undone in your aimless behavior to stamp you mad. What is it that troubles you? what news is there affecting you, you will be telling it to a loyal and trusty heart; for Tyndareus sent me that day to form part of your wife’s dowry and to wait upon the bride with loyalty. Say on and make it plain, that what my tongue utters may accord with what you have written. And how will Achilles, cheated of his bride, curb the fury of his indignation against you and your wife? Here also is a danger. It is his name, not himself that Achilles is lending, knowing nothing of the marriage or of my scheming or my professed readiness to betroth my daughter to him for a husband’s embrace. A dreadful venture yours, king Agamemnon, you that, by promise of your daughter’s hand to the son of the goddess, were bringing the maid here to be sacrificed for the Danaids. Ah me! I am utterly distraught; alas! bewilderment comes over me. Away! hurry your steps, yielding nothing to old age. I will make haste, king. Do not sit down by woodland fountains; scorn the witcheries of sleep. Hush! And when you pass any place where roads diverge, cast your eyes all round, taking heed that no mule-wagon eacape you, passing by on rolling wheels, bearing my child to the ships of the Danaids. It shall be so. Start then from the bolted gates, and if you meet the escort, start them back again, and drive at full speed to the abodes of the Cyclopes. But tell me, how shall my message find credit with your wife or child? Preserve the seal which you bear on this tablet. Away! Already the dawn is growing grey, lighting the lamp of day and the fire of the sun’s four steeds; help me in my trouble. To the sandy beach of sea-coast of far-famed Arethusa near the sea, so that I might behold the army of the Achaeans and the ships rowed by those godlike heroes; for our husbands tell us that fair-haired Menelaus and high-born Agamemnon are leading them to carried off from the banks of reedy Eurotas, his gift from Aphrodite, when that queen of Through the grove of Artemis, rich with sacrifice, I sped my course, my cheek stained with red from maiden modesty, in my eagerness to see the soldiers’ camp, the tents of the mail-clad Danaids, and their crowd of horses. and I saw Protesilaus and Palamedes, sprung from the son of Poseidon, sitting there amusing themselves with intricate figures at checkers; Diomedes too at his favorite sport of hurling quoits; and Meriones, Ares’ son, a marvel to mankind, stood at his side; likewise I beheld the son of Laertes, who came from his island hills, and with him Nireus, handsomest of the Achaeans. Achilles next, that nimble runner, swift on his feet as the wind, whom Thetis bore and Chiron trained, I saw upon the beach, racing in full armor along the shingle, and straining every nerve to beat a team of four horses, as he sped round the track on foot; and Eumelus, the grandson of Pheres, their driver, was shouting when I saw him, goading on his lovely steeds, with their bits of chased gold-work; the center pair, that bore the yoke, had dappled coats picked out with white, while the tracehorses, on the outside, facing the turning-post in the course, were bays with spotted fetlocks. Close beside them Peleus’ son leapt on his way, in all his harness, keeping abreast the rail by the axle-box. Next I sought the countless fleet, a wonder to behold, that I might fill my girlish eyes with gazing, a sweet The warlike Myrmidons from in golden effigy, the ensign of Achilles’ armament. Near these were moored the son, whom Talaus his grandfather reared, and Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, were in command; next in order, Theseus’ son was stationed at the head of sixty ships from Pallas set in a winged chariot drawn by steeds with solid hoof, a lucky sight for mariners. Then I saw decked with ensigns; these had Cadmus at the stern holding a golden dragon at the beaks of the vessels, and earth-born Leitus was their admiral. And there were ships from And from that the ensign of his neighbour Alpheus, four-footed like a bull. Moreover there was a squadron of twelve Aenianian sail under King Gouneus; and then near them the lords of Elis, whom all the people named Epeians; and Eurytus was lord of these; Iikewise he led the Taphian warriors with the white oar-blades, the subjects of Meges, son of Phyleus, who had left the isles of the Echinades, where sailors cannot land. Lastly, Aias, reared in was joining his right wing to the left saw the crews; the one who brings his barbaric boats to grapple Aias shall obtain no safe return. There I saw the naval armament, but some things I heard at home about the gathered army, of which I still have a recollection. Strange daring yours, Menelaus, where you have no right. Stand back! You carry loyalty to your master too far. The very reproach you have for me is to my credit. You shall rue it, if you meddle in matters that do not concern you. You had no right to open a letter, which I was carrying. No, nor you to be carrying sorrow to all Argue that point with others, but surrender that letter to me. I shall not let go. Nor will I let loose my hold. Why then, this staff of mine will be dabbling your head with blood before long. To die in my master’s cause would be a noble death. Let go! you are too wordy for a slave. Master, he is wronging me; he snatched your letter violently from my grasp, Agamemnon, and will not heed the claims of right. Ah! what is this uproar at the gates, this indecent brawling? My tale, not his, has the better right to be spoken. You, Menelaus! what quarrel do you have with this man, why are you dragging him here? Look me in the face! May that be the prelude to my story. Shall I, the son of Atreus, close my eyes from fear? Do you see this tablet, the bearer of a shameful message? I see it, yes; now, you first of all surrender it. No, not till I have shown its contents to all the army. What! have you broken the seal and  know already what you should never have known? Yes, I opened it and know to your sorrow the secret machinations of your heart. Where did you get it? O gods! what shameless heart you have! I was awaiting your daughter’s arrival at the camp in What right have you to watch my doings? is not this a proof of shamelessness? My wish to do it gave the spur, for I am no slave to you. Infamous! Am I not to be allowed the management of my own house? No, for you think crooked thoughts, one thing now, another formerly, and something different presently. Most exquisite refining on evil themes! Yes, but a mind unstable is an unjust possession, disloyal to friends. Now I am anxious to test you, and do not seek from rage to turn aside from the truth, nor will I on my part overstrain and keeping open doors for every fellow-townsman who cared to enter, affording each in turn chance to speak with you, even though some did not wish it, seeking by these methods to purchase popularity from all bidders? Then when you had secured the command, there came a change over your manners; you were no longer so cordial as before to former friends, but hard of access, seldom to be found at home. But the man of real worth ought not to change his manners in the hour of prosperity, but should then show himself most staunch to friends, when his own good fortune can help them most effectually. This was the first cause I had to reprove you, for it was here I first discovered your villainy; but afterwards, when you came ships at your command, had not occupied the plains of Priam with your armies! And you would ask my counsel, and gladly undertook to offer the girl, and of your own accord—never allege compulsion—you are sending word to your wife to despatch your daughter here on pretence of wedding Achilles. And after all you turn round and have been caught casting your letter to this effect: This is the same air that heard you say it. For my part, I am more sorry for our unhappy since any man, with ordinary intelligence, can govern a state. For brothers to come to words and blows, whenever they disagree, is terrible. I wish to rebuke you in turn, as a brother; for it is a good man’s way to be considerate. Tell me, why this burst of fury, these bloodshot eyes? who wrongs you? what is it you want? are you longing to have a virtuous wife? or is it my popularity that galls you? No! it is the longing you have to keep a beautiful woman in your embrace, casting reason and honor to the winds. A bad man’s pleasures are like himself. Am I mad, if I change to wiser counsels, after previously deciding amiss? Yours is the madness rather in wishing to recover a wicked wife, once you had lost her—a stroke of heaven-sent luck. Those foolish suitors swore that oath to Tyndareus in their longing to wed; but Hope was the goddess that led them on, where oaths have been wrongly pledged or forcibly extorted. I will not slay my children, nor Here is your answer shortly given, clear and easy to understand; and if you will not come to your senses, I shall do the best for myself. This differs from your previous declaration, but there is good in it, your child’s reprieve. Ah me, how sad my lot! I have no friends then after all. Friends you have, if you do not seek their destruction. Where will you find any proof that you are sprung from the same father as I? It is your moderation, not your madness, that I share by nature. Friends should sympathize with friends in sorrow. Claim my help by kindly service, not by paining me. So you have no mind to share this trouble with No, Go boast of your scepter, after betraying your own brother! while Agamemnon, lord of I have come and bring you your daughter, whom you call Iphigenia in your home; and her mother, your wife Clytemnestra, is with her, and the child Orestes, a sight to gladden but they had been travelling long and far, they are now resting their tender feet at the waters of a fair spring, they and their horses, for we turned these loose in the grassy meadow to browse their fill. But I have come as their forerunner to prepare you for their reception; for the army knows already of your daughter’s arrival, so quickly did the rumor spread; and all the people are running together to the sight, that they may see your child; for Fortune’s favorites enjoy world-wide fame and have all eyes fixed on them. Some say: Come, then, begin the rites, that is the next step, by getting the baskets ready; crown your heads—you too, You have my thanks; now go within; for the rest it will be well, as Fate proceeds. Ah, woe is me! unhappy wretch, what can I say? where shall I begin? To what cruel straits have I been plunged! A god has outwitted me, proving far cleverer than any cunning of mine. What an advantage humble birth possesses! for it is easy for her sons to weep and tell out all their sorrows; while to the high-born man come these same sorrows, but we heve dignity throned over our life and are the people’s slaves. how shall I welcome her? with what face meet her? for she too has undone me by coming uninvited in this my hour of sorrow; yet it was only natural she should come with her daughter to prepare the bride and perform the fondest duties, where she will discover my villainy. And for this poor maid—why maid? Death, it seems, will soon make her his bride—how I pity her! Thus will she plead to me, I think: While Orestes, from his station near us, will cry in childish accents, inarticulate, yet fraught with meaning. Alas! to what utter ruin I pity her myself, as a woman who is a stranger may grieve for the misfortunes of royalty. Your hand, brother! let me grasp it. I give it; yours is the victory, mine the sorrow. By Pelops our reputed grandsire and Atreus our father, I swear to tell you the truth from my heart, without any covert purpose, but only what I think. The sight of you in tears made me pity you, and in return I shed a tear for you myself; I withdraw from my former proposals, ceasing to be a cause of fear to you; yes, and I will put myself in your present position; What is it, after all, I seek? If I am set on marriage, could I not find a bride as choice elsewhere? Was I to lose a brother—the last I should have lost—to win a Helen, getting bad for good? I was mad, impetuous as a youth, till I perceived, on closer view, what slaying children really meant. Moreover I am filled with compassion for the hapless maiden, doomed to bleed that I may wed, when I reflect that we are kin. What has your daughter to do with Helen? Let the army be disbanded and leave A sudden change, you’ll say, from my dread proposals? A natural course for me; affection for my brother caused the change. These are the ways of a man not devoid of virtue, to pursue on each occasion what is best. A generous speech, worthy of Tantalus, the son of Zeus; you do not shame your ancestry. I thank you, Menelaus, for this unexpected suggestion; it is an honorable proposal, worthy of you. Sometimes love, sometimes the selfishness of their families, causes a quarrel between brothers; I loathe a relationship of this kind which is bitterness to both. How so? who will compel you to slay your own? The whole Achaean army here assembled. Not if you send her back to I might do that unnoticed, but there will be another thing I cannot. What is that? You must not fear the mob too much. Calchas will tell the Not if he should die before that—an easy matter. The whole tribe of seers is a curse with its ambition. Yes, and good for nothing and useless, when among us. Has the thought, which is rising in my mind, no terrors for you? How can I understand your meaning, unless you declare it? The son of Sisyphus knows all. Odysseus cannot possibly hurt us. He was ever shifty by nature, siding with the mob. True, he is enslaved by the love of popularity, a fearful evil. Don’t you think, then, he will arise among the Argives and tell them the oracles that Calchas delivered, saying of me that I undertook to offer Artemis a victim, and after all am proving false? Then, when he has carried the army away with him, he will bid the Argives slay us and sacrifice the girl; and if I escape to razing it to the ground, Cyclopean walls and all. That is my trouble. Woe is me! to what perplexities the gods have brought me at this pass! Take one precaution for me, Menelaus, as you go through the army, that Clytemnestra does not learn this, till I have taken my child and devoted her to death, that my affliction may be attended with the fewest tears. Happy are they who find the goddess come in moderate might, sharing with self-restraint in Aphrodite’s gift of marriage and enjoying calm and rest from frenzied passions, where the Love-god, golden-haired, stretches his charmed bow with twin arrows, and one is aimed at happiness, the other at life’s confusion. O lady Cypris, queen of beauty! far from my bridal bower I ban the last. Be mine delight in moderation and pure desires, and may I have a share in love, but shun excess! Men’s natures vary, and their habits differ, but virtue is always manifest. Likewise the training that come of education conduces greatly to virtue; for not only is modesty wisdom, but it has also the rare grace of seeing by its better judgment what is right; whereby a glory, ever young, is shed over life by reputation. A great thing it is to hunt virtue, for women when they love secretly; while in men, an inborn sense of order, shown in countless ways, You came, O among the white heifers of Ida, piping in foreign strain and breathing on your reeds an echo of the Phrygian airs where entranced eyes and feeling its flutter in your own breast; from which the fiend of strife brought Oh! great is the bliss the great enjoy. Behold Iphigenia, the king’s child, my lady, and Clytemnestra, the daughter of Tyndareus; how proud their lineage! how high their pinnacle of fortune! These mighty ones, whom wealth attends, are very gods in the eyes of less favored folk. Let us stand here, maidens of to the ground without stumbling, supporting her gently in our arms, with kind intent, that the renowned daughter of Agamemnon, just arrived, may feel no fear; strangers ourselves, let us avoid anything that may disturb or frighten the strangers from I take this as a lucky omen, your kindness and auspicious greeting, and have good hope that it is to a happy marriage I conduct the bride. My daughter, leave the horse-drawn chariot, planting your faltering footstep delicately. Young women, Some of you stand at the horses’ heads; for the horse has a timid eye, easily frightened; here, take this child Orestes, son of Agamemnon, baby as he still is. What! sleeping, little one, tired out by your ride in the chariot? Awake to bless your sister’s wedding; for you, my gallant boy, shall get by this marriage a kinsman gallant as yourself, the Nereid’s godlike offspring. Come here to your mother, my daughter, Iphigenia, and seat yourself beside me, and stationed near show my happiness to these strangers; yes, come here and welcome the father you love so dearly. Do not be angry with me, mother, if I run from your side and throw myself on my father’s breast. Hail! my honored lord, king Agamemnon! we have obeyed your commands and have come. You may do so, daughter; for of all the children I have borne, you have always loved your father best. I see you, father, joyfully after a long time. And I, your father, see you; your words do equal duty for both of us. All hail, father! you did well in bringing me here to you. I know not how I am to say yes or no to that, my child. Ah! how wildly you are looking, spite of your joy at seeing me. A man has many cares when he is king and general too. Be mine, all mine today; do not turn to moody thoughts. Why so I am, all yours today; I have no other thought. Then smooth your knitted brow, unbend and smile. See! my child, my joy at seeing you is even as it is. And do you then have tears streaming from your eyes? Yes, for long is the absence from each other, that awaits us. I do not know, dear father, I do not know of what you are speaking. You are moving my pity all the more by speaking so sensibly. My words shall turn to senselessness if that will cheer you more. Alas! this silence is too much. You have my thanks. Stay with your children at home, father. My own wish! Ruin seize their wars and the woes of Menelaus! First will that, which has been my life-long ruin, bring ruin to others. How long you were absent in the bays of Yes, and there is still a hindrance to my sending the army forward. Where do men say the Phrygians live, father? In a land where I wish It is a long voyage you are bound on, father, after you leave me. You will meet your father again, my daughter. Ah! would it were seemly for you to take me as a fellow voyager! You too have Shall I sail there with my mother or alone? All alone, without father or mother. What! have you found me a new home, father? Enough of this! it is not for girls to know such things. Please hurry home from There is a sacrifice I have first to offer here. Yes, it is your duty to heed religion with aid of holy rites. You will witness it, for you will be standing near the libations. Am I to lead the dance then round the altar, father? I count you happier than myself because you know nothing. Go within—it is wrong for maidens to be seen—after you have given me your hand and a kiss, on the eve of your lengthy sojourn far from your father’s side. Breast, cheek, and golden hair! ah, how grievous you have found Helen and the Phrygians’ city! I can speak no more; the tears come welling to my eyes, the moment I touch you. Go into the house.  commits his children to the homes of strangers. I am not so senseless; But I think I will go through this as well, when I lead the girl from the chamber to the sound of the marriage hymn; so I do not chide you; but custom will combine with time to make the smart grow less. As for him, to whom you have betrothed our daughter, I know his name, it is true, but want to learn his lineage and the land of his birth. There was one Who wedded her? Some mortal or a god? Zeus, and she bore Aeacus, the prince of Oenone. What son of Aeacus secured his father’s halls? Peleus, who wedded the daughter of Nereus. With the god’s consent, or when he had taken her in spite of gods? Zeus betrothed her, and her guardian gave consent. Where did he marry her? in the billows of the sea? In Chiron’s home, at sacred What! the abode ascribed to the race of Centaurs? It was there the gods celebrated the marriage feast of Peleus. Did Thetis or his father train Achilles? Chiron brought him up, to prevent his learning the ways of the wicked. Ah! wise the teacher, still wiser the one who gave his son. Such is the future husband of your daughter. A blameless lord; but what city in He dwells on the banks of the river Apidanus, in the borders of Will you convey He who takes her to himself will see to that. Happiness attend the pair! Which day will he marry her? As soon as the full moon comes to give its blessing Have you already offered the goddess a sacrifice to usher in the maiden’s marriage? I am about to do so; that is the very thing I was engaged in. And then will you celebrate the marriage feast afterwards? Yes, when I have offered a sacrifice required by the gods of me. But where am I to make ready the feast for the women? Here beside our gallant Argive ships. Finely here! but still I must; Do you know what to do, lady? Then obey me. In what matter? for I was ever accustomed to obey you. Here, where the bridegroom is, I will— Which of my duties will you perform in the mother’s absence? Give your child away with help of Danaids. And where am I to be then? Go to And leave my child? Then who will raise her bridal torch? I will provide the proper wedding torch. That is not the custom; but you think lightly of these things. It is not good for you to be alone among a soldier-crowd. It is good that a mother should give her own child away. Yes, and that those maidens at home should not be left alone. They are well guarded in their maiden bowers. Obey. No, by the goddess-queen of Go, manage matters out of doors; but in the house it is my place to decide Woe is me! my efforts are baffled; I am disappointed in my hope, anxious as I was to get my wife out of sight; foiled at every point, I form my plots and subtle schemes against my best-beloved. But I will go, in spite of all, with Calchas the priest, to inquire the goddess’s good pleasure, fraught with ill-luck as it is to me, and with trouble to a good and useful wife or none at all. The Hellenes’ gathered army will come in arms aboard their ships to Simois with its silver eddies, to whenever the god’s resistless prophecies inspire her. And on the towers of with brazen shields row in on shapely ships to the channels of the Simois, eager to take Helen, the sister of that heavenly pair whom Zeus begot, from Priam, and bear her back to of Achaean shields and spears. The son of Atreus, encircling around her stone-built towers, dragging Priam’s wife. And Helen, the daughter of Zeus, shall Never may there appear to me or to my children’s children the prospect which the wealthy Lydian ladies and Where is there are some, for instance, who, bing still unwed, have left their houses desolate and are idling here upon the beach, while others are married but without children; My own just plea I must declare, and whoever else has any wish will speak for himself. Though I have left Pharsalia, and Peleus, still I linger saying: Hail to you, son of the Nereid goddess! I heard your voice from within the tent and came forth. O modesty revered! who can this lady be whom I behold, so richly dowered with beauty’s gifts? No wonder you do not know me, seeing I am one you have never before set eyes on; I praise your reverent address to modesty. Who are you, and why have you come to the mustering of the Danaids—you, a woman, to a fenced camp of men? I am the daughter of Leda; my name is Clytemnestra; and my husband king Agamemnon. Well and shortly answered on all important points, but it is shameful for me to stand talking to women. Stay; why seek to escape? give me your hand, a prelude to a happy marriage. What is it you say? I give you my hand? To lay a finger where I have no right, I could never meet Agamemnon’s eye. The best of rights you have, seeing it is my child you will wed, O son of the sea-goddess, daughter of Nereus. What wedding do you speak of? Words fail me, lady; can your wits have gone astray and are you inventing this? All men are naturally shy in the presence of new relations, when these remind Lady, I have never courted your daughter, nor have the sons of Atreus ever mentioned marriage to me. What can it mean? Your turn now to marvel at my words, for yours are very strange to me. Hazard a guess; that we can both do in this matter; for it may be we are both correct in our statements. What! have I suffered such indignity? The marriage I am courting has no reality it seems; I am ashmed of it. Some one perhaps has made a mock of you and me; pay no heed to it; make light of it. Farewell; I can no longer face you with unfaltering eyes, after being made a liar and suffering undeservedly. It is Stranger of the race of Aeacus, stay awhile! Ho there! I mean you, O goddess-born, and you, daughter of Leda. Who is it calling through the half-opened door? What fear his voice betrays! A slave; of that I am not proud, for fortune does not permit it. Whose slave are you? not mine; for mine and Agamemnon’s goods are separate. I belong to this lady who stands before the tent, a gift to her from Tyndareus her father. I am waiting; tell me, if you are desirous, why you have stopped me. Are you really all alone here at the door? To us alone will you address yourself; come forth from the king’s tent. O Fortune and my own foresight, preserve whom I desire! That speech will save Delay not for the sake of touching my right hand, if there is anything that you would say to me. Well, you know my character and my devotion to you and your children. I know you have grown old in the service of my house. Likewise you know it was in your dowry king Agamemnon received me. Yes, you came to True; and I bear all goodwill to you, less to your husband. Come, come, unfold whatever you have to say. Her father, he that begot her, is on the point of slaying your daughter with his own hand. How? That for your story, old man! you are mad. Severing with a sword the hapless girl’s white throat. Ah, alas for me! Does my husband happen to have gone mad? No; he is sane, except where you and your daughter are concerned; there he is mad. What is his reason? what vengeful fiend impels him? Oracles, at least so Calchas says, in order that the army may start— Where? Alas for me, and for the one her father is going to kill! To the halls of Dardanus, that Menelaus may recover Helen. So Helen’s return then was fated to affect Iphigenia? You know all; her father is about to offer your child to Artemis. But that marriage—what pretext had it for bringing me from home? An inducement to you to bring your daughter cheerfully, to wed her to Achilles. On a deadly errand have you come, my daughter, both you, and I, your mother. Piteous the lot of both of you, and dreadful Agamemnon’s venture. Alas, I am undone; my eyes can no longer hold their tears. If the loss From where, old man, do you say you had this news? I had started to carry you a letter referring to the former writing. Forbidding or combining to urge my bringing the child to her death? No, forbidding it, for your lord was then in his sober senses. How comes it then, if you were really bringing me a letter, that you do not now deliver it into my hands? Menelaus snatched it from me, he who caused this trouble. Do you hear that, son of Peleus, the Nereid’s child? I have been listening to the tale of your sufferings, and I do not bear my own lightly. They will slay my child; they have tricked her with your marriage. Like you I blame your lord, nor do I view it with mere indifference. No longer will I let shame For you it was I wreathed her head and led her forth as if to marriage, but now it is to slaughter I am bringing her. On you will come reproach because you did not help her; for though not wedded to her, yet were you the loving husband of my hapless girl in name at any rate. By your beard, your right hand, and mother too I do implore you; for your name it was that worked my ruin, and you are bound to stand by that. Except your knees I have no altar to fly to; and not a friend stands though useful when they wish; Now if you boldly stretch forth your arm in my behalf, our safety is assured; but if not, we are lost. A strange thing is motherhood, carrying with it a potent spell, in which all share, so that for their children’s sake they will endure affliction. and rejoice in high prosperity with equal moderation. For these are the men who can count on ordering all their life rightly by wisdom’s rules. True, there are cases where it is pleasant not to be too wise, but there are others, where some store of wisdom helps. Brought up in godly Chiron’s halls myself, I learned to keep a single heart; and provided the Atridae lead well, I will obey them; but when they cease from that, no more will I obey; no, but here and in and never shall your daughter, after being once called my bride, die by her father’s hand; for I will not lend myself to your husband’s subtle tricks; no! for it will be my name that kills your child, although it does not wield the sword. Your own husband is the actual cause, but I shall no longer be guiltless, if, because of me and my marriage, this maiden perishes, she that has suffered past endurance and been the victim of affronts most strangely undeserved. So am I made the poorest wretch in I a thing of nothing, and Menelaus counting for a man! No son of Peleus I, but the issue of a vengeful fiend, if my name shall never shall king Agamemnon touch your daughter, no! not even to the laying of a finger-tip upon her robe; or Sipylus Calchas, the seer, shall rue beginning the sacrifice with his barley-meal and lustral water. Why, what is a seer? A man who with luck tells the truth sometimes, with frequent falsehoods, but when his luck deserts him, collapses then and there. It is not to secure a bride that I have spoken thus—there are maids unnumbered eager to have my love I would had yielded this to My sword shall soon know if any one is to snatch your daughter from me, for then will I make it reek with the bloody stains of slaughter, before it reach Son of Peleus, your words are alike worthy of you and that sea-born deity, the holy goddess. Ah! would I could find words to utter your praise without excess, and yet not lose the graciousness of it by stinting it; for when the good are praised, they have some sort of  feeling of hatred for those who in their praise exceed the mean. But I am ashamed of intruding a tale of woe, since my affliction touches myself alone and you are not affected by troubles of mine; but still it looks well for the man of worth to assist the unfortunate, even when he is not connected with then. Therefore pity us, for our suffering cries for pity; in the first place, I have harbored an idle hope, in thinking to have you marry my daughter; and next, perhaps, the slaying of my child will be to you an evil omen in your wooing hereafter, against which you must guard yourself. Your words were good, both first and last; for if you will it so, my daughter will be saved. Will you have her clasp your knees as a suppliant? it is no maid’s part; yet if it seems good to you, why, come she shall with the modest look of free-born maid; but if I shall obtain the same end from you without her coming then let her abide within, for there is dignity in her reserve; still reserve must only go as far as the case allows. for an army, when gathered together without domestic duties to employ it, loves the evil gossip of malicious tongues. After all, should you both supplicate me, you will attain a like result as if I had never been supplicated; One thing be sure you have heard; I will not tell a lie; if I do that or idly mock you, may I die, but live if I preserve the girl. Bless you for always helping the distressed! Hearken then to me, that the matter may succeed. What is your proposal? for hear you I must. Let us once more urge He is something of a coward, and fears the army too much. Still argument overthrows argument. Cold hope indeed; but tell me what I must do. Supplicate him first not to slay his children; and if he is stubborn, come to me. For and the army will not blame me, if I arrange the matter by reason rather than force; while, should things turn out well, the result will prove satisfactory both to you and your friends, even without my interference. How sensibly you speak! I must act as seems best to you; but should I fail of my object, where am I to see you again, where? Must I turn my wretched steps and find you ready to champion my distress? I will keep watch to guard you, where occasion calls, that none may see you passing through the army of Danaids with that scared look. Do not shame your father’s house; for Tyndareus does not deserve not to be ill spoken of, being a mighty man in It will be so. will find them favorable; if there are none, what need to toil? What wedding-hymn was that which raised its strains to the sound of Libyan flutes, to the music of the dancer’s lyre, and the note of the pipe of reeds? It was on the day and hymning in dulcet strains the praise of Thetis and the son of Aeacus, over the Centaurs’ hill, down woods of There was the Dardanian boy, dainty morsel of Zeus’ bed, drawing off the wine he mixed in the depths of golden bowls, Ganymede the Phrygian; while, along the gleaming sand, the fifty daughters of Nereus graced the marriage with their dancing, circling in a mazy ring. The revel-rout of Centaurs came too, mounted on horses, to the feast of the gods and the mixing-bowl of Bacchus, leaning on fir-trees, with skilled in arts inspired by Phoebus, gave his name; Then the gods shed a blessing on the marriage of the high-born bride, who was first of Nereus’ daughters, and on the wedding of Peleus. But the Argives will crown you, though you were never reared among the piping and whistling of herdsmen, but at your mother’s side, to be decked as the bride of a son of Inachus. or virtue have any strength? lawlessness over law prevailing, and mortals no I have come from the tent to look out for my husband, who went away and left its shelter long ago; while my poor child, hearing of the death her father designs for her, is in tears, uttering in many keys her piteous lamentation. who will soon be detected in the commission of a crime against his own child. Daughter of Leda, it is lucky I have found you outside the tent, to discuss with you in our daughter’s absence subjects not suited for the ears of maidens on the eve of marriage. What critical moment is it that you are seizing? Send the maiden out to join her father, for the lustral water stands there ready, and barley-meal to scatter with the hand on the cleansing flame, and heifers to be slain  before the marriage, in honor of the goddess Though the words you use are good, I do not know how I am to name your deeds in terms of praise. Come Behold! she comes, in obedience to your summons. I will speak the rest for her and for myself. My child, why do you weep and no longer look cheerfully? why are you fixing your eyes upon the ground and holding your robe before them? Ah! with which of my woes shall I begin? for I may treat them all as first, or put them last or midway, anywhere. What is it? I find you all alike, confusion and alarm in every eye. My husband, answer frankly the questions I ask you. There is no necessity to order me; I am willing to be questioned. Do you mean to slay your child and mine? Ha! these are heartless words, unwarranted suspicions! Peace! answer me that question first. Put a fair question and you shall have a fair answer. I have no other questions to put; give me no other answers. O fate revered, O destiny, and my fortune! Yes, and mine and hers too; the three share one bad fortune. Whom have I injured? Do you ask this question? A thought like that itself amounts to tboughtlessness. Ruined! my secret betrayed! I know all; I have heard what you are bent on doing to me. See, I am silent; for why should I tell you a falsehood, and add effrontery to misfortune? Well, now listen; for I will unfold my meaning and no longer employ dark riddles. In the first place—to reproach you first with this—it was not of my own free will but by force that you took and wed me, after slaying Tantalus, my former husband, and dashing but Tyndareus, my old father, rescued you because of your suppliant prayers, and you in turn had me to wife. Once I was reconciled to you upon this footing, you will bear me witness I have been a blameless wife to you and your family, chaste in love, an honor to your house, that so your coming in might be with joy and your going out with gladness. And it is seldom a man secures a wife like this, though the getting of a worthless woman Is no rarity. Besides three daughters, of one of whom you are heartlessly depriving me, I am the mother of this son of yours. If anyone asks you your reason for slaying her, tell me, what will you say? or must I say it for you? It is buying what we most detest and her chamber now deserted, and then sit down alone in tears, making ceaseless lamentation for her, For it needs Well; suppose you sacrifice the child; what prayer will you utter, when it is done? what will the blessing be that you will invoke upon yourself as you are slaying our daughter? An ill returning, seeing the disgrace that speeds your going forth? Is it right that I should pray for any luck to attend you? Surely we should deem the gods devoid of sense, if we harbored a kindly feeling towards murder? Shall you embrace your children on your coming back to in carrying a scepter about and marching at the head of an army? When you might have made this fair proposal among the Argives; your own child for the victim and presenting her to the Danaids; or Menelaus, as it was his concern, should have slain will return with her daughter, and live in happiness at Hearken to her, Agamemnon, for to join in saving your children’s lives is surely a noble deed; no one will deny this. If I had the eloquence of Orpheus, my father, to move the rocks by chanted spells to follow me, or to charm by speaking anyone I wished, I would have resorted to it. But as it is, I’ll bring my tears—the only art I know; for that I might attempt. And about your knees, as a suppliant, I twine my limbs—these limbs your wife here bore. Do not destroy me before my time, for it is sweet to look upon the light, and do not force me to visit scenes below. I was the first to call you father, you the first to call me child; I was the first to sit upon your knee and give and take the fond caress. And this was what you would saythen: I remember all we said, it is you who have forgotten and now would take my life. By Pelops, I entreat you spare me, by your father Atreus and my mother here, who suffers now a second time the pangs she felt before when bearing me! What have I to do with the marriage of as a memorial of you, though you do not heed my pleading.  O father, see this speechless supplication made to you; pity me; have mercy on my tender years! Yes, by your beard we two fond hearts implore your pity, the one a baby, a full-grown maid the other. By summing all my pleas in one, I will prevail in what I say: to gaze upon the light is man’s most cherished gift; that life below is nothingness, and whoever longs for death is mad. Better live a life of woe than die a death of glory! Ah, wretched Helen! Great is the struggle that has come sons to the of Atreus and their children, thanks to you and those marriages of yours. While loving my own children, I yet understand what should move my pity and what should not; I would be a madman otherwise. It is terrible for me to bring myself to this, nor is it less terrible to refuse, daughter; for I must do this. and the numbers of bronze-clad warriors from Hellas, who can neither make their way to to sail at once to the land of the barbarians, and put a stop to the rape of wives from nor have I followed his wish; no, it is pillaged of their wives by barbarian robbery. My child! oh, foreign women! Alas for me, for your death! Your father escapes, surrendering you to Hades. Alas for me, mother! for the same lament has fallen to both of us in our fortune. No more for me the light of day! no more these beams of the sun! Oh, oh! that snow-beat glen in where Priam once exposed a tender baby, torn from his mother’s arms to meet a deadly doom, in the Phrygians’ town. Would that he never had settled Alexander, the herdsman reared among the herds, beside that water crystal-clear, where are fountains of the Nymphs and their meadow rich with blooming flowers, where hyacinths and rose-buds blow for goddesses to gather! Here one day came Pallas and Cypris of the subtle heart, Hera too and Hermes messenger of Zeus; Cypris, proud of the longing she causes, Pallas of her prowess; and Hera of her royal marriage with king Zeus; to decide a hateful strife about their beauty; but it is my death, maidens, bringing, it is true, glory to the Danaids, that Artemis has received as an offering, before they begin the voyage to O mother, mother! he that begot me to this life of sorrow has gone and left me all alone. Ah! woe is me! a bitter, bitter sight for me was Helen, evil Helen! to me now doomed to bleed and die, slaughtered by an impious father! I wish this in its havens here the stems of their bronze-beaked ships, the fleet which was speeding them to a different breeze to different men, so that some have joy in setting sail, and sorrow some, and others hard constraint, to make some start and others prepare and others delay! Full of trouble then, it seems, is the race of mortals, full of trouble indeed; and it is Fate’s decree that man should find distress. Woe! woe to you, you child of Tyndareus, for the suffering and anguish sore, which you are causing the Danaids! I pity you for your cruel fate—a fate I would you never had met! O mother that bore me! I see a throng of men approaching. It is the goddess’ son you see, child, for whom you came here. Open the tent-door to me, servants, that I may hide myself Why seek to escape, my child? I am ashamed to face Achilles. But why? The luckless ending to our marriage causes me to feel abashed. No time for affectation now in face of what has happened. Stay then; reserve will do no good, if we may profit. Daughter of Leda, lady of sorrows! No misnomer that. A fearful cry is heard among the Argives. What is it? tell me. It concerns your child. An evil omen for your words. They say her sacrifice is necessary. And is there no one to say a word against them? Indeed I was in some danger myself from the tumult. In danger of what, stranger?. Of being stoned. Surely not for trying to save my daughter? The very reason. Who would have dared to lay a finger on you? All the men of Were not your Myrmidon warriors at your side? They were the first who turned against me. My child! we are lost, it seems. They taunted me as the man whom marriage had enslaved. And what did you answer them? Not to kill the one I meant to wed— Justly so. The wife her father promised me. Yes, and sent to fetch from But I was overcome by clamorous cries. Truly the mob is a dire mischief. But I will help you for all that. Will you really fight them single-handed? Do you see these warriors here, carrying my arms? Bless you for your kind intent! Well, I shall be blessed. Then my child will not be slaughtered now? No, not with my consent at any rate. But will any of them come to lay hands on the maid? Thousands of them, with Odysseus at their head. The son of Sisyphus? The very same. Acting for himself or by the army’s order? By their choice—and his own. An evil choice indeed, to stain his hands in blood. But I will hold him back. Will he seize and bear her off against her will? Yes, by her golden hair no doubt. What must I do, when it comes to that? Keep hold of your daughter. Be sure that she shall not be slain, as far as that that can help her. Believe me, it will come to this. Mother, hear me while I speak, for I see that you are angry with your husband to no purpose; it is hard for us to persist in impossibilities. Our thanks are due to this stranger for his ready help; but you must also see to it that he is not reproached by the army, leaving us no better off and himself involved in trouble. Listen, mother; hear what thoughts have passed across my mind. I am resolved to die; and this I want to do with honor, dismissing from me what is mean. Towards this now, mother turn your thoughts, and with me weigh how well I speak; to me the whole of mighty and in my power it lies to check henceforth barbarian raids on happy Besides, I have no right at all to cling too fondly to my life; for you did not bear me for myself alone, but as a public blessing to all and my one life prevent all this? What If Artemis has decided to take my body, am I, a mortal, to thwart the goddess? no, that is impossible. I give my body to And it is right, mother, that Hellenes should rule barbarians, but not barbarians Hellenes, those being slaves, while these are free. You play a noble part, maiden; but the whims of Fate and the goddess are diseased. Daughter of Agamemnon! some god was bent on blessing me, if I could have won you for my wife. In you I consider But now that I have looked into your noble nature, I feel still more a fond desire to win you for my bride. Look to it; for I want to serve you and receive you in my halls; and, Thetis be my witness, how I grieve to think I shall not save your life by doing battle with the Danaids. Reflect, I say; a dreadful ill is death. This I say, without regard to anyone. but let me, if I can, save Heroic spirit! I can say no more to this, since you are so minded; for yours is a noble resolve; why should not one speak the truth? Yet I will speak, for you will perhaps change your mind; So I will not let you perish through any thoughtlessness of yours, but will go to the goddess with these arms and await your arrival there. Mother, why so silent, your eyes wet with tears? I have reason, woe is me! to be sad at heart. Stop; do not make me a coward; here in one thing obey me. Tell me, my child, for at my hands you shall never suffer injury. Cut not off the tresses of your hair for me, nor clothe yourself in sable garb. Why, my child, what is it you have said? When I have lost you? You wll not lose me; I am saved and you renowned, as far as I can make you. How so? Must I not mourn your death? By no means, for I shall have no tomb heaped over me. What then? It is death, not the tomb, that is rightly mourned. The altar of the goddess, Zeus’s daughter, will be my tomb. Well, my child, I will let you persuade me, for you speak well. Yes, as one who prospers and does What message shall I carry to your sisters? Do not put mourning raiment on them either. But is there no fond message I can give the maidens from you? Yes, my farewell words; and promise me to rear Orestes to manhood. Press him to your bosom; it is your last look. O you that are most dear to me! you have helped your friends as you had means. Is there anything I can do in Yes, do not hate my father, your own husband. Fearful are the trials through which he has to go because of you. It was against his will he ruined me for the sake of Ah! but he employed base treachery, unworthy of Atreus. Who will escort me from here, before my hair is torn? I will go with you— No, not you; that is not well saidl. Clinging to your robes. Be persuaded by me, mother, stay here; for this is the better way both for me and you; but let one of these attendants of my father conduct me to the meadow of Artemis, where I shall be sacrificed. Are you gone from me, my child? Yes, and with no chance of ever returning. Leaving your mother? Yes, as you see, undeservedly. Hold! do not leave me! I cannot let you shed a tear. Begin the sacrifice with the baskets, let the fire blaze for the purifying meal of sprinkling, and my father pace from left to right about the altar; for I come to bestow on Lead me away, the destroyer of Dance to Artemis, queen Artemis the blest, around her shrine and altar; for by the blood of my sacrifice I will blot out the oracle, if it must be. O mother, lady revered! I will, not give you my tears; for at the holy rites it is not fitting. Sing with me, maidens, sing the praises of Artemis, whose temple faces where angry spearmen madly chafe, here in the narrow havens of O Pelasgia, land of my birth, and Is it on Perseus’ citadel you call, that town Cyclopean workmen built? To be a light to You are right; no fear that fame will ever desert you! Hail to you, bright lamp of day and light of Zeus! A different life, a different lot is henceforth mine. Farewell I bid you, light beloved! Behold the maiden on her way, the destroyer of the altar of a murderous goddess, when her shapely neck is severed. For you fair streams of a father’s pouring and lustral waters are in store, for you to reach the citadel of O lady revered, delighting in human sacrifice, send on its way to a crown of fairest glory for the spearmen of Come forth, O Clytemnestra, daughter of Tyndareus, from the tent, to hear my news. I heard your voice and have come in sad dismay and fearful dread, not sure but what you have arrived with tidings of some fresh trouble for me besides the present woe. No, rather I want to unfold to you a strange and marvellous story about your child. Do not delay, then, but speak at once. Dear mistress, you shall learn all clearly; from the outset will I tell it, unless my memory fails me somewhat and confuses my tongue in its account. As soon as we reached the grove of Artemis, the child of Zeus, and the flowery meadows, where the Achaean troops were gathered, bringing your daughter with us, at once the Argive army began assembling; but when king Agamemnon saw the maiden on her way to the grove to be sacrificed, he gave one groan, and, turning away his face, let the tears burst from his eyes, as he held his robe before them. But the maid, standing close by her father, spoke thus: She spoke; and each man marvelled, as he heard the maiden’s brave speech. But in the midst Talthybius stood up, for this was his duty, and bade the army refrain from word or deed; and Calchas, the seer, drawing a sharp sword from its scabbard laid it in a basket of beaten gold, and crowned the maiden’s head. Then the son of Peleus, taking the basket and with it lustral water in his hand, ran round the altar of the goddess uttering these words: Meanwhile the sons of Atreus and all the army stood looking on the ground. [But the priest, seizing his knife, offered up a prayer and was closely scanning the maiden’s throat to see where he should strike. It was no slight sorrow filled my heart, as I stood by with bowed head; when there was a sudden miracle! Each one of us distinctly heard the sound of a blow, at the sight of a marvel all unlooked for, due to some god’s agency, and passing all belief, although it was seen; for there upon the ground lay a deer of immense size, magnificent to see, gasping out her life, with whose blood the altar of the goddess was thoroughly bedewed. Then spoke Calchas thus—his joy you can imagine— Then, when the sacrifice was wholly burnt to ashes in the blazing flame, he offered such prayers as were fitting, that the army might win return; but Agamemnon sends me to tell you this, and say what heaven-sent luck is his, and how he has secured undying fame throughout the length of for the gods’ ways with man are not what we expect, and those whom they love, they keep safe; yes, for this day has seen your daughter dead and living. What joy to hear these tidings from the messenger! He tells you your child is living still, among the gods. Which of the gods, my child, has stolen you? How am I to address you? How can I be sure See! king Agamemnon approaches, to confirm this story for you. Lady, we may be counted Fare you well! it is long before I shall greet you on my return from Son of Atreus, start for  \n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Hermes of the nether world, you who guard the powers that are your father’s, to hearken, to hear me What is this I see? What is this throng of women that moves in state, marked by their sable cloaks?  To what calamity should I set this down?  Is it some new sorrow that befalls our house?  Or am I right to suppose that for my  father’s sake they bear these libations to appease the powers below? It can only be for this cause: for indeed I think my own sister Electra is approaching, distinguished by her bitter grief. Oh grant me, Zeus, to avenge my father’s death, and may you be my willing ally! Pylades, let us stand apart,that I may know clearly what this band of suppliant women intends. Sent forth from the palace I have come to convey libations to the sound of sharp blows of my hands.  My cheek is marked with bloody gashes where my nails have cut fresh furrows. And yet through all my life my heart is fed with lamentation.  Rips are torn by my griefs through the linen web of my garment, torn in the cloth that covers my breast, the cloth of robes struck for the sake of my mirthless misfortunes. For with a hair-raising shriek, Terror, the diviner of dreams for our house, breathing wrath out of sleep, uttered a cry of terror in the dead of night from the heart of the palace, a cry that fell heavily on the women’s quarter. beneath the earth cast furious reproaches and rage against their murderers. Intending to ward off evil with such a graceless grace, O mother Earth, she sends me forth, godless woman that she is. But I am afraid to utter the words she charged me to speak.  For what atonement is there for blood fallen to earth?  Ah, hearth of utter grief! Ah, house laid low in ruin! Sunless darkness, loathed by men, enshrouds our house due to the death of its master. Because of blood drunk up by the fostering earth, the vengeful gore lies clotted and will not dissolve away.  Soul-racking calamity distracts the guilty man till he is steeped in utter misery. For since the gods laid constraining doom about my city and led me from my father’s house to a slave’s lot, it is fitting for me to govern my bitter hate, even against my will, and submit to the wishes of my masters, whether just or unjust. But I weep beneath my veil over the senseless fate of my lord, my heart chilled by secret grief. You handmaidens who set our house in order, since you are here as my attendants in this rite of supplication, give me your counsel on this:  what should I say while I pour these offerings of sorrow?  How shall I find gracious words, how shall I entreat my father?  Shall I say that I bring these offerings to a loved husband from a loving wife—from my own mother? I do not have the assurance for that, nor do I know what I should say as I pour this libation onto my father’s tomb.  Or shall I speak the words that men are accustomed to use: a gift, indeed, to match their evil? In this, my friends, be my fellow-counsellors. For we cherish a common hatred within our house.  Do not hide your counsel in your hearts in fear of anyone.  For the portion of fate awaits both the free man and the man enslaved by another’s hand. If you have a better course to urge, speak! In reverence for your father’s tomb, as if it were an altar, I will speak my thoughts from the heart, since you command me. Speak, even as you revere my father’s grave. While you pour, utter benedictions for loyal hearts. And to whom of those dear to me should I address them? First to yourself, then to whoever hates Aegisthus. Then for myself and for you also shall I make this prayer? That is for you, using your judgment, to consider now for yourself. Then whom else should I add to our company? Remember Orestes, though he is still away from home. Well said!  You have indeed admonished me thoughtfully. For the guilty murderers now, mindful of— What should I say?  Instruct my inexperience, prescribe the form. Pray that some divinity or some mortal may come to them— As judge or as avenger, do you mean? Say in plain speech, And is it right for me to ask this of the gods? How could it not be right to repay an enemy with ills? Supreme herald of the realm above and the realm below, O Hermes of the nether world, come to my aid, summon to me the spirits beneath the earth to hear my prayers, spirits that watch over my father’s house, and Earth herself, who gives birth to all things, and having nurtured them receives their increase in turn.  And meanwhile, as I pour these lustral offerings to the dead, I invoke my father: It is right for you to crown them with lamentations, raising your voices in a chant for the dead. Pour forth your tears, splashing as they fall for our fallen lord, to accompany this protection against evil, this charm for the good against the loathsome pollution.  Hear me, oh hear me, my honored lord, out of the darkness of your spirit. a man mighty with the spear to deliver our house, an Ares, brandishing in the fight the springing Scythian bow and wielding his hilted sword in close combat. My father has by now received the libations, which the earth has drunk. But take your share of this startling news. Speak—but my heart is dancing with fear. I see here a lock cut as an offering for the tomb. A man’s, or a deep-girt maid’s? That is open to conjecture—anyone may guess. How then?  Let my age be taught by your youth. There is no one who could have cut it but myself. Yes, for those who ought to have mourned with a lock of hair are enemies. And further, in appearance it is very much like— Whose lock?  This is what I would like to know. It is very much like my own in appearance. Then can this be a secret offering from Orestes? It is his curling locks that it most resembles. But how did he dare to come here? He has merely sent this cut lock to honor his father. What you say is no less a cause of tears for me, if he will never again set foot on this land. Over my heart, too, there sweeps a surge of bitterness, and I am struck as if a sword had run me through. From my eyes thirsty drops of a stormy flood fall unchecked at the sight of this tress. For how can I expect to find that someone else, some townsman, owns this lock?  Nor yet in truth did she clip it from her head, the murderess, my own mother, who has assumed a godless spirit regarding her children that ill accords with the name of mother.  But as for me, how am I to assent to this outright, that it adorned the head of Orestes, the dearest to me of all mortals?  No, hope is merely flattering me. Ah, woe!  If only, like a messenger, it had a kind voice, so that I would not be tossed by my distracted thoughts. Rather it would plainly bid me to spurn this tress, if it was severed from a hated head.  Or if it were a kinsman’s, he would share my grief as an adornment to this tomb and a tribute to my father. And look!  Another proof!  Footprints>matching each other—and like my own!  Yes, here are the outlines of two sets of feet, his own and some companion’s.  The heels and the imprints of the tendons agree in proportion with my own tracks. I am in torment, my brain is in a whirl! Give recognition to the gods that your prayers have been fulfilled, and pray that success may attend you in the future. What?  Have I succeeded now by the will of the gods? You have come to the sight of what you have long prayed for. And do you know whom among mortals I was invoking? I know that you are pining for Orestes. Then how have I found an answer to my prayers? Here I am.  Search for no other friend than me. But surely, stranger, you are weaving some snare about me? Then I am devising plots against myself. No, you wish to mock my distress. Then my own also, if yours. Am I then to address you as Orestes in truth? Now, even though you see him in me, you are slow to learn. Yet at the sight of this tress cut in mourning, and when you were scrutinizing the footprints of my tracks, your thought took wings and you knew you had found me. Put the lock of hair, your own brother’s, in the spot it was cut from and observe how it matches the hair on my head. And see this piece of weaving, your handiwork, the strokes of the batten and the beasts in the design.  Control yourself!  Do not go mad with joy!  For I know that our nearest kin are bitter foes to us both. O best beloved darling of your father’s house, its hope of a saving seed longed for with tears, trust in your prowess and you will win back your father’s house.  O delightful eyes that have four parts of love for me:  for I must call you father; and to you falls the love I should bear my mother, whom I most rightly hate; and the love I bore my sister, victim of a pitiless sacrifice; and you were my faithful brother, bringing me your reverence.  May Might and Justice, with Zeus, supreme over all, in the third place, lend you their aid! O Zeus, O Zeus, regard our cause!  Behold the orphaned brood of a father eagle that perished in the meshes, in the coils of a fierce viper. They are utterly orphaned, gripped by the famine of hunger: for they are not grown to full strength to bring their father’s quarry to the nest.  So you see both me and poor Electra here, children bereft of their father, both outcasts alike from our home. If you destroy these nestlings of a father who made sacrifice and revered you greatly, from what like hand will you receive the homage of rich feasts?  Destroy the brood of the eagle and you cannot again send tokens that mortals will trust; nor, if this royal stock should wither utterly away, will it serve your altars on days when oxen are sacrificed. Oh foster it, and you may raise our house from low estate to great, though now it seems utterly overthrown. O children, O saviors of your father’s hearth, speak not so loud, dear children, in case someone should overhear and report all this to our masters merely for the sake of rumor.  May I some day see them dead in the ooze of flaming pitch! Surely he will not abandon me, the mighty oracle of Loxias, who urged me to brave this peril to the end and loudly proclaims calamities that chill the warmth of my heart, if I do not take vengeance on my father’s murderers.  He said that, I should pay the debt myself with my own life, after many grievous sufferings.  For he spoke revealing to mortals the wrath of malignant powers from underneath the earth, and telling of plagues: leprous ulcers that mount with fierce fangs on the flesh and eat away its primal nature; and how a white down For the dark bolt of the infernal powers, who are stirred by kindred victims calling for vengeance, and madness, and groundless terrors out of the night, torment and harass a man, and he sees clearly, though he moves his eyebrows in the dark. he is even chased in exile from his country. And the god declared that to such as these it is not allowed to have a part either in the ceremonial cup or in the cordial libation; his father’s wrath, though unseen, bars him from the altar; no one receives him or lodges with him; and at last, despised by all, friendless, he perishes, shrivelled pitifully by a death that wastes him utterly away. Besides the god’s command, my keen grief for my father, and also the pinch of poverty—that my countrymen, the most renowned of mortals, who overthrew For he has a woman’s mind, or if not, it will soon be found out. You mighty Fates, through the power of Zeus grant fulfilment in the way to which Justice now turns. Justice cries out as she exacts the debt, O father, unhappy father, by what word or deed of mine can I succeed in sailing from far away to you, where your resting-place holds you, a light to oppose your darkness? Yet a lament in honor of the Atreidae who once possessed our house is none the less a joyous service. My child, the fire’s ravening jaw does not overwhelm the wits of the dead man, but afterwards he reveals what stirs him.  The murdered man has his dirge; the guilty man is revealed.  Justified lament for fathers and for parents, when raised loud and strong, makes its search everywhere. Hear then, O father, as in turn we mourn with plentiful tears.  Look, your two children mourn you in a dirge over your tomb. As suppliants and exiles as well they have sought a haven at your sepulchre.  What of these things is good, what free of evil?  Is it not hopeless to wrestle against doom? Yet heaven, if it pleases, may still turn our utterance to more joyfully sounding strains.  In place of dirges over a tomb, a song of triumph within the royal halls will welcome back a reunited friend. Ah, my father, if only beneath and in their maturity you would have made their lives admired by men. And in a land beyond the sea you would have found a tomb heaped high with earth, no heavy burden for your house to bear— —Welcomed there below by your comrades who nobly fell, a ruler of august majesty, distinguished even beneath the earth, and minister of the mightiest, the deities who rule in the nether world. For in your life you were a king of those who have the power to assign the portion of death, No, not even beneath the walls of would I wish you to have fallen and to be entombed beside Scamander’s waters among the rest of the host slain by the spear. I wish rather that his murderers had been killed by their own loved ones, just as they killed you, so that someone in a distant land who knew nothing of these present troubles should learn of their fatal doom. In this, my child, your wish is better than gold.  It surpasses great good fortune, even that of the supremely blesssed; But now the lash of this double scourge This has pierced the earth and reached your ear And yet it will be accomplished for our father’s sake. May it be mine to raise a hearty shout in triumph over the man when he is stabbed and over the woman as she perishes!  Why should I try to keep hidden what nevertheless hovers before my soul? Full against the prow of my heart wrath blows sharply in rancorous hate. And when will mighty Zeus bring down his hand on them and split their heads open? Let it be a pledge to the land!  After injustice I demand justice as my right.  Hear, O Earth, and you honored powers below! And it is the eternal rule that drops of blood spilled on the ground demand yet more blood. Murder cries out on the Fury, which from those killed before brings one ruin in the wake of another. Alas, you sovereign powers of the world below, behold, you potent Curses of the slain, behold the remnants of the line of Atreus in their helpless plight, cast out from house and home in dishonor. Which way can we turn, O Zeus? But again my heart throbs as I hear this pitiful lament. At once I am devoid of hope and my viscera are darkened at the words I hear. But when hope once again lifts and strengthens me, it puts away my distress and dawns brightly on me. To what could we more fittingly appeal than to those very miseries we have endured from the woman herself who bore us? She may fawn upon us, but they are past all soothing. For like a fierce-hearted wolf the temper we have acquired from our mother is implacable. On my breast I beat With clenched fists, raining blows thick and fast, my outstretched hands could be seen descending from above, from far above, now on this side, now on that, till my battered and wretched head resounded with the strokes. Away with you, cruel and utterly brazen mother! You dared to give your husband a most cruel burial: unmourned, without lamentation, a king unattended by his people. Ah me, your words spell utter dishonor. Yet with the help of the gods, and with the help of my own hands, will she not atone for the dishonor she did my father? Let me only take her life, then let me die! Yes, and I would have you know he was brutally mangled. And even as she buried him in this way, she acted with intent to make the manner of his death a burden on your life past all power to bear.  You hear the story of the ignominious outrage done to your father. My father was murdered just as you say. But all the while I was kept sequestered, despised, accounted a worthless thing. Kennelled in my room as if I were a vicious cur, I gave free vent to my streaming tears, which came more readily than laughter, as in my concealment I poured out my lament in plentiful weeping. Hear my tale and inscribe it on your heart. Yes, let it sink deep into your ears, but keep inside a quiet steadfastness of soul.  So far things are so.  But you yourself be eager to resolve what is to follow. You must enter the contest with inflexible wrath. Father, I call on you; side with your loved ones! And I in tears join my voice to his. And let all our company blend our voices to echo the prayer.  Hear!  Come to the light! Side with us against the foe! Ares will encounter Ares; Right will encounter Right. O you gods, judge rightly the plea of right! A shudder steals over me as I hear these prayers. Doom has long been waiting, but it will come in answer to those who pray. Ah, inbred trouble and bloody stroke of ruin striking a discord!  Ah, lamentable and grievous sorrows! Ah, the unstaunched pain! Our house has a cure to heal these woes, a cure not from outside, from the hands of others, but from itself, by fierce, bloody strife. This hymn is for the gods beneath the earth. O you blessed powers below, hear this supplication of ours, and with a favorable will send forth to these children your aid for victory! O father, who perished by a death unbefitting a king, grant in answer to my prayer the lordship over your halls! And I too, father, have a like request of you: to escape when I have wrought great destruction on Aegisthus. Yes, for then the customary funeral feasts of men would be established in your honor.  But otherwise, at the rich and savory banquet of burnt offerings made to the earth, you will be without a portion of honor. And I will likewise at my wedding offer libations to you out of the fullness of my inheritance from my father’s house, and before all else I will hold this tomb of yours in the highest honor. O Earth, send up my father to watch my battle! O Persephone, grant us indeed a glorious victory! Father, remember the bath where you were robbed of life. And remember how they devised a strange net to cast about you. You were caught, my father, in fetters forged by no smith’s hand. And in a fabric shamefully devised. Father, are you not roused by taunts such as these? Are you not raising that dearest head of yours? Either send Justice to battle for those dear to you, or grant us in turn to get a similar grip So listen, father, to this last appeal of mine as you behold these fledglings crouching at your tomb. Have compassion on your offspring, on the woman and on the man as well, and let not this seed of Pelops’ line be blotted out: for then, in spite of death, you are not dead. For children are voices of salvation to a man, though he is dead; like corks, they buoy up the net, saving the flaxen cord from out of the deep.  Hear!  For your own sake we make this lament.  By honoring this plea of ours you save yourself. In truth you have drawn out this plea of yours to your own content in showing honor to this unlamented tomb. As for the rest, since your heart is rightly set on action, put your fortune to the test and get to your work at once. It will be so.  But it is in no way amiss to inquire how, from what motive, she came to send her libations, seeking too late to make amends for an irremediable deed.  They would be a sorry gift to send to the senseless dead: I cannot guess what they mean. The gifts are too paltry for her offence. For though a man may pour out all he has in atonement for one deed of blood, it is wasted effort.  So the saying goes. If indeed you know, tell me: I wish to learn. I know, my child, for I was there.  It was because she was shaken by dreams and wandering terrors of the night that she sent these offerings, godless woman that she is. And have you learned the nature of the dream so as to tell it properly? She dreamed she gave birth to a serpent: that is her own account. And where does the tale end, and what is its consummation? She laid it to rest as if it were a child, in swaddling clothes. What food did it crave, the newborn viper? In her dream she offered it her own breast. Surely her nipple was not unwounded by the loathsome beast? No: it drew in clotted blood with the milk. Truly it is not without meaning: the vision signifies a man! Then from out of her sleep she raised a shriek and awoke appalled, and many lamps that had been blinded in the darkness flared up in the house to cheer our mistress.  Then she sent these libations for the dead in the hope that they might be  an effective cure for her distress. Well then, I pray to this earth and to my father’s grave that this dream may come to its fulfilment in me. As I understand it, it fits at every point.  For if the snake left the same place as I; if it was furnished with my swaddling clothes; if it sought to open its mouth to take the breast that nourished  me and mixed the sweet milk with clotted blood while she shrieked for terror at this, then surely, as she has nourished a portentous thing of horror, she must die by violence.  For I, turned serpent, am her killer, as this dream declares. I choose your reading of this portent.  Let it be so.  As for the rest, give your friends their parts.  Tell some what to do, others what to leave undone. It is a simple story.  My sister must go inside, and I charge her to keep concealed this pact with me, so that as by craft they killed a worthy man, so by craft they may likewise be caught and perish in the very same snare, even as Loxias decreed, lord Apollo, the prophet who has never before been false. In the guise of a stranger, one fully equipped,I will come to the outer gate, and with me Pylades, whom you see here, as a guest and ally of the house. Both of us will speak the speech of on the plea that the house is afflicted with trouble by the gods, then we will wait so that anyone passing the house will consider and say: But if I indeed pass the outermost threshold of the gate and find that man sitting on my father’s throne, or if then coming face to face with me he lifts and casts down his eyes, know well: before he can even say so that our plans may fit together well. You Many are the horrors, dread and appalling, bred of earth, and the arms of the deep teem with hateful monsters.  Likewise between heaven and earth lights But who can tell of man’s overweening spirit, and of the reckless passions of women hardened of soul, partners of the woes of mortals?  Inordinate passion, overmastering the female, gains a fatal victory over the wedded unions of beasts and humans alike. Let whoever is not flighty in his wits know this, when he has learned of the device of a lit brand contrived by Thestius’ heartless daughter: and it aged in pace with him through his life to the day decreed by fate. And there is in legend another murderous virgin to be loathed, who ruined a loved one at the bidding of his foes, when, lured by Minos’ gift, the Cretan necklace forged of gold, she with her dog’s heart despoiled Nisus of his immortal lock as he drew breath in unsuspecting sleep. And Hermes But since I have recalled tales of pitiless afflictions, it is the right time to tell of a marriage void of love, an abomination to the house, and the plots devised by a wife’s cunning against her warrior lord, against her lord revered with reason by his foes. But I honor the hearths of homes not heated by passion’s fires, and in woman a spirit that shrinks from audacious deeds. Indeed the Lemnian and because of a woeful deed abhorred by the gods a race has disappeared, cast out in infamy from among mortals. For no man reveres what is hated by the gods.  Is there one of these tales I have gathered that I do not justly cite? But the keen and bitter sword is near the breast and drives home its blow at the bidding of Justice. For truly the injustice of him who has unjustly transgressed the sovereign majesty of Zeus lies on the ground trampled under foot. The anvil of Justice is planted firm.  Destiny fashions her arms and forges her sword quickly, and the famed and deeply brooding Fury is bringing the son into our house, to requite at last the pollution of blood shed long ago. Boy! Boy!  Hear my knocking at the outer door!  Who is inside? Boy! Boy! I say again, who is at home? Again for the third time I call for some one to come out of the house, if by Aegisthus’ will it offers welcome to strangers. Yes, yes, I hear.  Of what land is the stranger, and whence? Announce me to the masters of the house, for it is in fact to them that I come bearing news. And hurry, since the chariot of night is speeding on with darkness, and it is time for wayfarers to drop anchor in some house friendly to all guests.  Tell some one to come forth who has authority over the house, the mistress in charge.  But the master would be more fitting, for then no delicacy in speaking makes words obscure: man speaks boldly to man and reveals his meaning without reserve. Strangers, you have only to declare your need, for we have everything that suits this house: warm baths, beds to charm away fatigue, and the presence of honest faces.  But if there is another matter requiring graver counsel, that is the concern of men, and we will communicate with them. I am a stranger, a Daulian of the Phocians.  As I was on my way, carrying my pack on business of my own to just as I ended my journey here, I do not know.  But his parent should know the truth. Oh no!  Your story spells our utter undoing.  O curse that haunts this house, so hard to wrestle down: how far forward you look!  Even what was laid well out of harm’s way you bring down with your well-aimed shafts from far off, and you strip me of those I love, utterly wretched as I am. And now Orestes: he was indeed prudent in keeping his foot out of the mire of destruction, but now mark down as having abandoned us what was once the one hope in our house of a cure for its fine revelry. As for me, I am sure that with hosts so prosperous I would rather have been made known and welcomed for favorable news.  For where is goodwill greater than from guest to host?  Yet to my mind it would have been irreverent not to fulfill for friends a charge like this when I was bound by promise and hospitality pledged to me. Rest assured you will receive no less a reward than you deserve nor be the less welcome to this house: someone else might just as well have brought your message. But it is the hour when strangers who have been travelling on a long day’s journey should have their proper entertainment. I command you to do this as you shall be held to strict account. Meantime we will communicate this matter to the master of the house, and since we have no lack of friends we will confer on this occurrence. Ah, loyal handmaidens of the house, low long will it be before we display the power that lies in our mouths to do Orestes service? now hear me, now lend me aid! Now is the hour for Persuasion with her guile to join forces with him, and for Hermes of the nether world, who works in stealth, to direct this encounter of the deadly sword. My mistress commands me to summon Aegisthus for the strangers in all haste, so that he may come and learn more clearly, from man to man, these tidings that have just arrived. Indeed, before the servants, behind eyes that feigned grief she hid her laughter over what has occurred fortunately for her. But the news so plainly told by the strangers means utter ruin for this house. I expect that when he hears it he will rejoice in his heart to know the story. Miserable woman that I am!  How the old unbearable troubles of every sort that occurred in this house of Atreus have always made my heart ache within my breast!  But never yet have I endured a blow like this.  For all the other troubles I bore patiently, but my beloved Orestes, on whom I spent my soul, whom I took from his mother at birth and nursed, and the many and troublesome tasks, fruitless for all my enduring them, when his loud and urgent cries broke my rest....  For one must nurse the senseless thing like a dumb beast, of course one must, by following its humor. For while it is still a baby in swaddling clothes, it has no speech at all, whether hunger moves it, or thirst perhaps, or the call of need: children’s young insides work their own relief.  I would anticipate these needs.  Yet many a time, I think, having to wash the child’s linen because of my own errors, laundress and nurse had the same function. It was I who, with these two handicrafts, received Orestes for his father.  And now, wretch that I am, I hear that he is dead.  But I am on my way to fetch the man who wrought destruction on our house, and he will be glad enough to hear this news. Then arrayed how does she tell him to come? Arrayed how?  Say it again so that I may catch your meaning better. With his guards or perhaps unattended? She tells him to come with his retinue of spearmen. Well, do not give this message to our loathed master, but with all haste and with a cheerful heart tell him to come himself, alone, so that he may be told without alarm.  For in the mouth of a messenger a crooked message is made straight. What!  Are you gladdened at heart by the present news? Why not, if Zeus at last may cause our ill wind to change? But how can that be?  Orestes, the hope of our house, is gone. Not yet; he would be a poor prophet who would so interpret. What are you saying?  Do you know something beyond what has been told? Go, deliver your message!  Do what you are asked to do! The gods take care of what they take care of. Well, I will go and do your bidding.  With the gods’ blessing may everything turn out for the best! Now at my supplication, O Zeus, father of the Olympian gods, grant that the fortunes of our house be firmly established, so that those who rightly desire the rule of order may behold it.  Every word of mine has been uttered in justice.  O Zeus, may you safeguard it! O Zeus, set him who is within the palace before his foes; since, if you exalt him, he will gladly pay you with double and triple recompense. Know that the orphaned colt of a loved one is harnessed to the chariot of distress. And by setting bounds to his course may you grant that we see him keep a steady pace through this race and win the goal in the straining stride of a gallop. And you who within the house inhabit the inner chamber that exults in its wealth, hear me, you gods, that feel with us!  By a fresh award redeem the blood of deeds done long ago. May aged Murder cease begetting offspring in our house! And you who occupy the mighty, gorgeously built cavern, eyes it may behold from under its veil of gloom the radiant light of freedom. May Maia’s son, But by his mysterious utterance he brings darkness over men’s eyes by night, and by day he is no more clear at all. And then at last with a loud voice we shall sing a song of the deliverance of our house, the song that women raise when the wind sits fair, and not the shrill strain of those who mourn: But may you with good courage, when the part of action comes, cry out loud the name and accomplish the baneful but irreproachable deed. Raise up Perseus’ spirit within my breast.  And for those dear to you below the earth, and for those above, exact satisfaction for their dire wrath by working bloody ruin in our house and obliterating the guilt of murder. I have come not unasked but summoned by a messenger.  I heard startling news told by some strangers who have arrived, tidings far from  welcome: —that Orestes is dead.  To lay this too upon our house would be a fearful burden when it is still festering and galled by the wound inflicted by an earlier murder.  How can I believe this tale is the living truth?  Or is it merely a panic-stricken report spread by women which leaps up to die away in nothingness?  What can you tell me of this to make it plain to my mind? We heard the tale, it is true.  But go inside and inquire of the strangers.  The certainty of a messenger’s report is nothing compared with one’s own interrogation of the man himself. I wish to see the messenger and put him to the test again—whether he himself was present at the death or merely repeats from vague reports what he has heard.  No!  Be sure he cannot deceive a mind with eyes open. O Zeus, O Zeus, what should I say? Where shall I begin this prayer of mine, this appeal to the gods? How in my loyal zeal can I succeed in finding words to match need?  Now is the moment when the blood-stained edges of the blades that lay men low are utterly forever to destroy the house of Agamemnon.   Or else, kindling a flaming light in the cause of freedom, Orestes will win both the rule over his realm and the rich possessions of his fathers. Our gallant Orestes, with no one to assist him, is now to meet with two in such a contest.  And may it be to triumph!  Ah!  Ah!  Alas! What is happening?  What is being accomplished for our house?  Let us stand apart while the matter is still unsettled so that we may be considered blameless in these ills.  For the issue of the fighting has now been decided. O woe, oh utter woe!  My master is slain! O woe!  I cry yet again, for the third time.  Aegisthus is no more!  Come, with all speed!  Unbar and open the women’s door!  And a strong arm indeed is needed, but not to help him who is already slain: what good is there in that? Help!  Help! Am I shouting to the deaf and fruitlessly wasting my voice on people who are asleep? Where has Clytaemestra gone?  What is she doing? Her own neck, near the razor’s edge, is now ready to fall beneath the stroke. What is this?  What cry for help are you raising in our house? I tell you the dead are killing the living. Ah!  Indeed I grasp the meaning of the riddle.  We are to perish by treachery, just as we committed murder.  Someone give me a battle-axe, and quickly!  Let us know if we are victors or vanquished: for I have even come to this in this wretched business. It is you I seek.  He over there has had enough. Oh no!  My beloved, valiant Aegisthus!  You are dead! You love this man?  Then you will lie in the same grave, and you will never abandon him in death. Wait, my son!  Have pity, child, upon this breast at which many times while you slept you sucked with toothless gums the milk that nourished you. Pylades, what shall I do?  Shall I spare my mother out of pity? What then will become in the future of Loxias’ oracles declared at I judge you victor: you advise me well. Sleep with him in death, since you love him but hate the man you were bound to love. It was I who nourished you, and with you I would grow old. What!  Murder my father and then make your home with me? Fate, my child, must share the blame for this. And fate now brings this destiny to pass. Have you no regard for a parent’s curse, my son? You brought me to birth and yet you cast me out to misery. No, surely I did not cast you out in sending you to the house of an ally. I was sold in disgrace, though I was born of a free father. Then where is the price I got for you? I am ashamed to reproach you with that outright. But do not fail to proclaim the follies of that father of yours as well. Do not accuse him who suffered while you sat idle at home. It is a grief for women to be deprived of a husband, my child. Yes, but it is the husband’s toil that supports them while they sit at home. You seem resolved, my child, to kill your mother. You will kill yourself, not I. Take care: beware the hounds of wrath that avenge a mother. And how shall I escape my father’s if I leave this undone? I see that though living I mourn in vain before a tomb. Yes, for my father’s fate has marked out this destiny for you. Oh no! I myself bore and nourished this serpent! Yes, the terror from your dream was indeed a prophet.  You killed him whom you should not; so suffer what should not be.  Truly I grieve even for these in their twofold downfall.  Yet since long-suffering Orestes has reached the peak of many deeds of blood, we would rather have it so, that the eye of the house should not be utterly lost. As to Priam and his sons justice came at last in crushing retribution, so to Agamemnon’s house came a twofold lion, twofold slaughter. The exile, the suppliant of Oh raise a shout of triumph over the escape of our master’s house from its misery and the wasting of its wealth by two who were unclean, its grievous fortune! And he has come whose part is the crafty vengeance of stealthy attack, and in the battle his hand was guided by her who is in very truth daughter of Zeus, breathing murderous wrath on her foes. We mortals aim true to the mark when we call her Justice. The commands proclaimed loudly by Loxias, tenant of the mighty cavern shrine of the mischief now become inveterate.  May the divine word prevail that so I may not serve the wicked! It is right to revere the rule of heaven. Look, the light has come, and I am freed from the cruel curb that restrained our household.  House, rise up!  You have lain too long prostrate on the ground. But soon time that accomplishes all will pass the portals of our house, and then all pollution will be expelled from the hearth by cleansing rites that drive out calamity.  The dice of fortune will turn as they fall and lie with faces all lovely to behold, favorably disposed to whoever stays in our house. Look, the light has come, and I am freed from the cruel curb that restrained our household.  House, rise up!  You have lain too long prostrate on the ground. Behold this pair, oppressors of the land, who murdered my father and ransacked my house!  They were majestic then, when they sat on their thrones, and are lovers even now, as one may judge by what has happened to them, and their oath holds true to their pledges.  Together they vowed a league of death against my unhappy father, and together they vowed to die, and they have kept their promise well. the device for binding my unhappy father, with which his hands were manacled, his feet fettered.  Spread it out!  Stand around in a circle, and display this covering for a man, that the Father may see—not mine, but he who surveys all this, the Sun— that he may see the impious work of my own mother, that he may be my witness in court that I justly pursued this death, my own mother’s.  For I do not speak of Aegisthus’ death: he has suffered the penalty prescribed for adulterers. But she who devised this abhorrent deed against her husband, whose children she bore, a burden under her belt, a burden once dear, but now a hateful ill, as it seems: what do you think of her?  Had she been born a seasnake or a viper, I think her very touch without her bite would have caused anyone else to rot, if shamelessness and an immoral disposition could do so. This would be the kind of thing a highwayman might posses, who deceives strangers and earns his living by robbery, and with this cunning snare he might kill many men and warm his own heart greatly. Before that may the gods grant me to perish childless! Alas!  Alas!  Sorrowful work!  You were done in by a wretched death.  Alas!  Alas!  And for the survivor also suffering blossoms. Did she do the deed or not? No, this is my witness, dyed by Aegisthus’ sword.  This is a stain of blood that helps time to spoil the many tinctures of embroidered fabric. Yet I grieve for the deed and the punishment and for my whole clan.  My victory is an unenviable pollution. No mortal being shall pass his life unscathed, free from all suffering to the end. Alas!  Alas!  One tribulation comes today, another tomorrow. But since I would have you know, for I do not know how it will end: I think I am a charioteer driving my team far beyond the course.  For my ungoverned wits are whirling me away overmastered, and at my heart fear wishes to sing and dance to a tune of wrath. But while I am still in my senses, I proclaim to those who hold me dear and declare that not without justice did I slay my mother, the unclean murderess of my father, and a thing loathed by the gods. my chief source.  It was he who declared that, if I did this thing, I would be acquitted of wrongdoing.  But if I refrained—I will not name the penalty; for no bowshot could reach such a height of anguish. the precinct of Loxias, and to the bright fire said to be imperishable. I go forth a wanderer, estranged from this land, leaving this repute behind, in life or death. And you have done well.  Therefore do not yoke your tongue to an ill-omened speech, nor let your lips give vent to evil forebodings, since you have freed the whole realm of Ah, ah!  You handmaidens, look at them there: like Gorgons, wrapped in sable garments, entwined with swarming snakes!  I can stay no longer. What fantasies disturb you, dearest of sons to your father?  Wait, do not be all overcome by fear. To me these are no imagined troubles.  For there indeed are the hounds of wrath to avenge my mother. It is that the blood is still fresh on your hands; this is the cause of the disorder that assails your wits. O lord Apollo, look!  Now they come in troops, and from their eyes they drip loathsome blood! There is one way to cleanse you: the touch of Loxias will set you free from this affliction. You do not see them, but I see them.  I am pursued. I can stay no longer. Then may blessings go with you, and may the god watch benevolently over you and guard you with favorable fortunes!  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Ah! would to Heaven the good ship Argo ne’er had sped its course to the Colchian land through the misty blue Symplegades, nor ever in the glens of Pelion the pine been felled to furnish with oars the chieftain’s hands, who went to fetch the golden fleece for Pelias; for then would my own mistress Medea never have sailed to the turrets of Iolcos, her soul with love for Jason smitten, nor would she have beguiled the daughters of Pelias to slay their father and come to live here in the land of Corinth with her husband and children, where her exile found favour with the citizens to whose land she had come, and in all things of her own accord was she at one with Jason, the greatest safeguard this when wife and husband do agree; but now their love is all turned to hate, and tenderest ties are weak. For Jason hath betrayed his own children and my mistress dear for the love of a royal bride, for he hath wedded the daughter of Creon, lord of this land. While Medea his hapless wife, thus scorned, appeals to the oaths he swore, recalls the strong pledge his right hand gave, and bids heaven be witness what requital she is finding from Jason. And here she lies fasting, yielding her body to her grief, wasting away in tears ever since she learnt that she was wronged by her husband, never lifting her eye nor raising her face from off the ground; and she lends as deaf an ear to her friend’s warning as if she were a rock or ocean billow, save when she turns her snow-white neck aside and softly to herself bemoans her father dear, her country and her home, which never to quit one’s native land. And she hates her children now and feels no joy at seeing them; I am afeard she may contrive some untoward scheme; for her mood is dangerous nor will she brook her cruel treatment; full well I know her, and I much do dread that she will plunge the keen sword through their heart, stealing without a word into the chamber where their marriage couch is spread, or else that she will slay the prince and bridegroom too, and so find some calamity still more grievous than the present; for dreadful is her wrath; verily the man that doth incur her hate will have no easy task to raise o’er her a song of triumph. Lo! where her sons come hither from their childish sports; little they reck of their mother’s woes, for the soul of the young is no inend to sorrow. Why dost thou, so long my lady’s own handmaid, stand here at the gate alone, loudly lamenting to thyself the piteous tale? how comes it that Medea will have thee leave her to herself? Old man, attendant on the sons of Jason, our masters’ fortunes when they go awry make good slaves grieve and touch their hearts. Oh! I have come to such a pitch of grief that there stole a yearning wish upon me to come forth hither and proclaim to heaven and earth my mistress’s hard fate. What! has not the poor lady ceased yet from her lamentation? Would I were as thou art! the mischief is but now beginning; it has not reached its climax yet. O foolish one, if I may call my mistress such a name; how little she recks of evils yet more recent! What mean’st, old man? grudge not to tell me. ’Tis naught; I do repent me even of the words I have spoken. Nay, by thy beard I conjure thee, hide it not from thy fellow-slave; I will be silent, if need be, on that text. I heard one say, pretending not to listen as I approached the place where our greybeards sit playing draughts that Creon, the ruler of this land, is bent on driving these children and their mother from the boundaries of Corinth; but I know not whether the news is to be relied upon, and would fain it were not. What! will Jason brook such treatment of his sons, even though he be at variance with their mother? Old ties give way to new; he bears no longer any love to this family. Undone, it seems, are we, if to old woes fresh ones we add, ere we have drained the former to the dregs. Hold thou thy peace, say not a word of this; ’tis no time for our mistress to learn hereof. O children, do ye hear how your father feels towards you? Perdition catch him, but no! he is my master still; yet is he proved a veiy traitor to his nearest and dearest. And who ’mongst men is not? Art learning only now, that every single man cares for himself more than for his neighbour, some from honest, motives, others for mere gain’s sake? seeing that to indulge his passion their father has ceased to love these children. Go, children, within the house; all will be well. Do thou keep them as far away as may be, and bring them not near their mother in her evil hour. For ere this have I seen her eyeing them savagely, as though she were minded At least may she turn her hand against her foes, and not against her friends.  ’Tis as I said, my dear children; wild fancies stir your mother’s heart, wild fury goads her on. Into the house without delay, come not near her eye, approach her not, beware her savage mood, the fell tempest of her reckless heart. In, in with what speed ye may. For ’tis plain she will soon redouble her fury; that cry is but the herald of the gathering storm-cloud whose lightning soon will flash; what will her proud restless soul, in the anguish of despair, be guilty of?  Ah me! ah me! the pity of it! Why, pray, do thy children share their father’s crime? Why hatest thou them? Woe is you, poor children, how do I grieve for you lest ye suffer some outrage! Strange are the tempers of princes, and maybe because they seldom have to obey, and mostly lord it over others, change they their moods with difficulty. ’Tis better then to have been trained to live on equal terms. Be it mine to reach old age, not in proud pomp, but in security! Moderation wins the day first as a better word for men to use, and likewise it is far the best course for them to pursue; but greatness that doth o’erreach itself, brings no blessing to mortal men; but pays a penalty of greater ruin whenever fortune is wroth with a family. I heard the voice, uplifted loud, of our poor Colchian lady, nor yet is she quiet; speak, aged dame, for as I stood by the house with double gates I heard a voice of ’Tis a house no more; all that is passed away long since; a royal bride keeps Jason at her side, while our mistress pines away in her bower, finding no comfort for her soul in aught her friends can say.  What gain is life to me? Woe, woe is me! O, to die and win release, quitting this loathed existence! Didst hear, O Zeus, thou earth, and thou, O light, the piteous note of woe the hapless wife is uttering? How shall a yearning for that insatiate And if thy lord prefers a fresh love, be not angered with him for that; Zeus will judge ’twixt thee and him herein. Then mourn not for thy husband’s loss too much, nor waste thyself away.  for that they presume to wrong me thus unprovoked. O my father, my country, that I have left to my shame, after slaying my own brother. Do ye hear her words, how loudly she adjures Themis, oft invoked, and Zeus, whom men regard as keeper of their oaths? On no mere trifle surely will our mistress spend her rage. Would that she would come forth for us to see, and listen to the words of counsel we might give, if haply she might lay aside the fierce fury of her wrath, and her temper stern. Never be my zeal at any rate denied my friends! But go thou and bring her hither outside the house, and tell her this our friendly thought; haste thee ere she do some mischief to those inside the house, for this sorrow of hers is mounting high. This will I do; but I have my doubts whether I shall persuade my mistress; still willingly will I undertake this trouble for you; albeit, she glares upon her servants with the look of a lioness with cubs, whenso anyone draws nigh to speak to her. Wert thou to call the men of old time rude uncultured boors thou wouldst not err, seeing that they devised their hymns for festive occasions, for banquets, and to grace the board, a pleasure to catch the ear, shed o’er our life, but no man hath found a way to allay hated grief by music and the minstrel’s varied strain, whence arise slaughters and fell strokes of fate to o’erthrow the homes of men. And yet this were surely a gain, to heal men’s wounds by music’s spell, but why tune they their idle song where rich banquets are spread? for of itself doth the rich banquet, set before them, afford to men delight. I heard a bitter cry of lamentation! loudly, bitterly she calls on the traitor of her marriage bed, her perfidious spouse; by grievous wrongs oppressed she invokes Themis, bride of Zeus, witness of oaths, who brought her unto Hellas, the land that fronts the strand of Asia, o’er the sea by night through ocean’s boundless gate. From the house I have come forth, Corinthian ladies, for fear lest you be blaming me; for they, or ever they have surely learnt their neighbour’s heart, loathe him at first sight, though never wronged by him; and so a stranger most of all should adopt a city’s views; nor do I commend that citizen, who, in the stubbornness of his heart, from churlishness resents the city’s will. But on me hath fallen this unforeseen disaster, and sapped my life; ruined I am, and long to resign the boon of existence, kind friends, and die. For he who was all the world to me, as well thou knowest, hath turned out the veriest villain, my own husband. Of all things that have life and sense we women are the most hapless creatures; first must we buy a husband at an exorbitant price, and o’er ourselves a tyrant set which is an evil worse than the first; and herein lies the most important issue, whether our choice be good or bad. For divorce is discreditable to women, nor can we disown our lords. Next must the wife, coming as she does to ways and customs new, since she hath not learnt the lesson in her home, have a diviner’s eye to see how best to treat the partner of her life. If haply we perform these tasks with thoroughness and tact, and the husband live with us, without resenting the yoke, our life is a happy one; if not, ’twere best to die. But when a man is vexed with what he finds indoors, he goeth forth and rids his soul of its disgust, betaking him to some friend or comrade of like age; whilst we must needs regard his single self. And yet they say we live secure at home, while they are at the wars, with their sorry reasoning, for I would gladly take my stand in battle array three times o’er, than once give But enough! this language suits not thee as it does me; thou hast a city here, a father’s house, some joy in life, and friends to share thy thoughts, but I am destitute, without a city, and therefore scorned by my husband, a captive I from a foreign shore, with no mother, brother, or kinsman in whom to find a new haven of refuge from this calamity. Wherefore this one boon and only this I wish to win from thee,— thy silence, if haply I can some way or means devise to avenge me on my husband for this cruel treatment, and on the man who gave to him his daughter, and on her who is his wife. For though a woman be timorous enough in all else, and as regards courage, a coward at the mere sight of steel, yet in the moment she finds her honour wronged, no heart is filled with deadlier thoughts than hers. This will I do; for thou wilt be taking a just vengeance on thy husband, Medea. That thou shouldst mourn thy lot surprises me not. But lo! I see Creon, king of this land coming hither, to announce some new resolve. Hark thee, Medea, I bid thee take those sullen looks and angry thoughts against thy husband forth from this land in exile, and with thee take both thy children and that without delay, for I am judge in this sentence, and I will not return unto my house till I banish thee beyond the borders of the land. Ah, me! now is utter destruction come upon me, unhappy that I am! For my enemies are bearing down on me full sail, nor have I any landing-place to come at in my trouble. Yet for all my wretched plight I will ask thee, Creon, wherefore dost thou drive me from the land? I fear thee,—no longer need I veil my dread ’neath words,—lest thou devise against my child some cureless ill. Many things contribute to this fear of mine; thou art a witch by nature, expert in countless sorceries, and thou art For ’tis better for me to incur thy hatred now, lady, than to soften my heart and bitterly repent it hereafter. Alas! this is not now the first time, but oft before, O Creon, hath my reputation injured me and caused sore mischief. Wherefore whoso is wise in his generation ought never to have his children taught to be too clever; for besides the reputation they get for idleness, they purchase bitter odium from the citizens. For if thou shouldst import new learning amongst dullards, thou will be thought a useless trifler, void of knowledge; while if thy fame in the city o’ertops that of the pretenders to cunning knowledge, thou wilt win their dislike. I too myself share in this ill-luck. Some think me clever and hate me, others find me hard to please and not so very clever after all. Be that as it may, thou dost fear me lest I bring on thee something to mar thy harmony. Fear me not, Creon, ray position scarce is such that I should seek to quarrel with princes. Why should I, for how hast thou injured me? Thou hast betrothed thy daughter where thy fancy prompted thee. No, ’tis my husband I hate, though I doubt not thou hast acted wisely herein. And now I grudge not thy prosperity; betroth thy child, good luck to thee, but let me abide in this land, for though I have been wronged I will be still and yield to my superiors. Thy words are soft to hear, but much I dread lest thou art devising some mischief in thy heart, and less than ever do I trust thee now; for a cunning woman, and man likewise, is easier to guard against when quick-tempered O, say not so! by thy knees and by thy daughter newly-wed, I do implore! Thou wastest words; thou wilt never persuade me. What, wilt thou banish me, and to my prayers no pity yield? I will, for I love not thee above my own family. O my country! what fond memories I have of thee in this hour! Yea, for I myself love my city best of all things save my children. Ah me! ah me! to mortal man how dread a scourge is love! That, I deem, is according to the turn our fortunes take. O Zeus! let not the author of these my troubles escape thee. Begone, thou silly woman, and free me from my toil. The toil is mine, no lack of it. Soon wilt thou be thrust out forcibly by the hand of servants. Not that, not that, I do entreat thee, Creon! Thou wilt cause disturbance yet, it seems. I will begone; I ask thee not this boon to grant. Why then this violence? why dost thou not depart? Suffer me to abide this single day and devise some plan for the manner of my exile, and means of living for my children, since their father cares not to provide his babes therewith. Then pity them; thou too hast children of thine own; thou needs must have a kindly heart. For my own lot I care naught, though I an exile am, but for those babes I weep, that they should learn what sorrow means. Mine is a nature anything but harsh; full oft by showing pity have I suffered shipwreck; and now albeit I clearly see my error, yet shalt thou gain this request, lady; but I do forewarn thee, if to-morrow’s rising sun shall find thee and thy children within the borders of this land, thou diest; my word is spoken and it will not lie. So now, if abide thou must, stay this one day only, for in it thou canst not do any of the fearful deeds I dread. Ah! poor lady, woe is thee! Alas, for thy sorrows! Whither wilt thou turn? What protection, what home or country to save thee from thy troubles wilt thou find? O Medea, in what a hopeless sea of misery heaven hath plunged thee! On all sides sorrow pens me in. Who shall gainsay this? But all is not yet lost! think not so. Still are there troubles in store for the new bride, and for her bridegroom no light toil. Dost think I would ever have fawned on yonder man, unless to gain some end or form some scheme? Nay, I would not so much as have spoken to him or touched him with my hand. But he has in folly so far stepped in that, though he might have checked my plot by banishing me from the land, he hath allowed me to abide this day, in which I will lay low in death three of my enemies— a father and his daughter and my husband too. Now, though I have many ways to compass their death, I am not sure, friends, which I am to try first. Shall I set fire to the bridal mansion, or plunge the whetted sword through their hearts, softly stealing into the chamber where their couch is spread? One thing stands in my way. If I am caught making my way into the chamber, intent on my design, I shall be put to death and cause my foes to mock. ’Twere best to take the shortest way—the way we women are most skilled in—by poison to destroy them. Well, well, suppose them dead; what city will receive me? What friendly host will give me a shelter in his land, a home secure, and save my soul alive? in case some tower of defence rise up for me; then will I proceed to this bloody deed in crafty silence; but if some unexpected mischance drive me forth, I will with mine own hand seize the sword, e’en though I die for it, and slay them, and go forth on my bold path of daring. By that dread queen whom I revere before all others and have chosen to share my task, by Hecate who dwells within my inmost chamber, not one of them shall wound my heart and rue it not. Bitter and sad will I make their marriage for them; bitter shall be the wooing of it, bitter my exile from the land. Up, then, Medea, spare not the secrets of thy art in plotting and devising; on to the danger. Now comes a struggle needing courage. Dost see what thou art suffering? ’Tis not for thee to be a laughing-stock to the race of Sisyphus Back to their source the holy rivers turn their tide. Order and the universe are being reversed. ’Tis men whose counsels are treacherous, whose oath by heaven is no longer sure. Rumour shall bring a change o’er my life, bringing it into good repute. Honour’s dawn is breaking for woman’s sex; no more shall the foul tongue of slander fix upon us. The songs of the poets of old shall cease to make our faithlessness their theme. Phoebus, lord of minstrelsy, hath not implanted in our mind the gift of heavenly song, else had I sung an answering strain to the race of males, for time’s long chapter affords many a theme on their sex as well as ours. With mind distraught didst thou thy father’s house desert on thy voyage betwixt ocean’s twin rocks, and on a foreign strand thou dwellest, thy bed left husbandless, poor lady and Gone is the grace that oaths once had. Through all the breadth of Hellas honour is found no more; to heaven hath it sped away. For thee no father’s house is open, woe is thee! to be a haven from the troublous storm, while o’er thy home is set another queen, the bride that is preferred to thee. It is not now I first remark, but oft ere this, how unruly a pest is a harsh temper. For instance, thou, hadst thou but patiently endured the will of thy superiors, mightest have remained here in this land and house, but now for thy idle words wilt thou be banished. Thy words are naught to roe. Cease not to call Jason basest of men; but for those words thou hast spoken against our rulers, count it all gain that exile is thy only punishment. I ever tried to check the outbursts of the angry monarch, and would have had thee stay, but thou wouldst not forego thy silly rage, always reviling our rulers, and so thou wilt be banished. Yet even after all this I weary not of my goodwill, but am come with thus much forethought, lady, that thou mayst not be destitute nor want for aught, when, with thy sons, thou art cast out. Many an evil doth exile bring in its train with it; for even though thou hatest me, never will I harbour hard thoughts of thee. Thou craven villain (for that is the only name my tongue can find for thee, a foul reproach on thy unmanliness)! comest thou to me, thou, most hated foe of gods, of me, and of all mankind? Tis no proof of courage or hardihood to confront thy friends after injuring them, but that worst of all human diseases—loss of shame. Yet hast thou done well to come; for I shall ease ray soul by reviling thee, and thou wilt be vexed at my recital. I will begin at the very beginning. I saved thy life, as every Hellene knows who sailed with thee aboard the good ship Argo, when thou wert sent to tame and yoke fire-breathing bulls, and to sow the deadly tilth. Yea, and I slew the dragon which guarded the golden fleece, keeping sleepless watch o’er it with many for my love was stronger than my prudence. Next I caused the death of Pelias by a doom most grievous, even by his own children’s hand, beguiling them of all their fear. All this have I done for thee, thou traitor! and thou hast cast me over, taking to thyself another wife, though children have been bom to us. Hadst thou been childless still, I could have pardoned thy desire for this new union. Gone is now the trust I put in oaths. I cannot even understand whether thou thinkest that the gods of old no longer rule, or that fresh decrees are now in vogue amongst mankind, for thy conscience must tell thee thou hast not kept faith with me. Ah! poor right hand, which thou didst often grasp. These knees thou didst embrace! All in vain, I suffered a traitor to touch me! How short of my hopes I am fallen! But come, I will deal with thee as though thou wert my friend. Yet what kindness can I expect from one so base as thee? but yet I will do it, for my questioning will show thee yet more base. Whither can I turn me now? to my father’s house, to my own country, which I for thee deserted to come hither? to the hapless daughters of Pelias? A glad welcome, I trow, would they give me in their home, whose father’s death I compassed! My case stands even thus: I am become the bitter foe to those of mine own home, and those whom I need ne’er have wronged I have made mine enemies to pleasure thee. Wherefore to reward me for this thou hast made me doubly blest in the eyes of many a wife in Hellas; and in thee I own a peerless, trusty lord. O woe is me, if indeed I am to be cast forth an exile from the land, without one friend; one lone woman with her babes forlorn! Yea, a fine reproach to thee in thy bridal hour, that thy children and the wife who saved thy life are beggars and vagabonds! O Zeus! why hast thou granted unto man clear signs to know the sham in There is a something terrible and past all cure, when quarrels arise ’twixt those who are near and dear. Needs must I now, it seems, turn orator, and, like a good helmsman on a ship with close-reefed sails, weather that wearisome tongue of thine. Now, I believe, since thou wilt exaggerate thy favours, that to Cypris alone of gods or men I owe the safety of my voyage. Thou hast a subtle wit enough; yet were it a hateful thing for me to say that the Love-god constrained thee by his resistless shaft to save my life. However, I will not reckon this too nicely; ’twas kindly done, however thou didst serve me. Yet for my safety hast thou received more than ever thou gavest, as I will show. First, thou dwellest in Hellas, instead of thy barbarian land, and hast learnt what justice means find how to live by law, not by the dictates of brute force; and all the Hellenes recognize thy cleverness, and thou hast gained a name; whereas, if thou hadst dwelt upon the confines of the earth, no tongue had mentioned thee. Give me no gold within my halls; nor skill to sing a fairer strain than ever Orpheus sang, unless therewith my fame be spread abroad! So much I say to thee about my own toils, for ’twas thou didst challenge me to this retort. As for the taunts thou urgest against my marriage with the princess, I will prove to thee, first, that I am prudent herein, next chastened in my love, and last a powerful friend to thee and to thy sons; only hold thy peace. Since I have here withdrawn from Iolcos with many a hopeless trouble at my back, what happier device could I, an exile, frame than marriage with the daughter of the king? ’Tis not because I loathe thee for my wife—the thought that rankles in thy heart; ’tis not because I am smitten with desire fot a new bride, nor yet that I am eager to vie with others in begetting many children, for those we have are quite enough, and I do not complain. Nay, ’tis may dwell in comfort, instead of suffering want (for well I know that every whilom friend avoids the poor), and that I might rear my sons as doth befit my house; further, that I might be the father of brothers for the children thou hast born, and raise these to the same high rank, uniting the family in one,— to my lasting bliss. Thou, indeed, hast no need of more children, but me it profits to help my present family by that which is to be. Have I miscarried here? Not even thou wouldest say so unless a rival’s charms rankled in thy bosom. No, but you women have such strange ideas, that you think all is well so long as your married life runs smooth; but if some mischance occur to ruffle your love, all that was good and lovely erst you reckon as your foes. Yea, men should have begotten children from some other source, no female race existing; thus would no evil ever have fallen on mankind. This speech, O Jason, hast thou with specious art arranged; but yet I think—albeit in saying so I betray indiscretion—that thou hast sinned in casting over thy wife. No doubt I differ from the mass of men on many points; for, to my mind, whoso hath skill to fence with words in an unjust cause, incurs the heaviest penalty; for such an one, confident that he can cast a decent veil of words o’er his injustice, dares to practise it; and yet he is not so very clever after all. So do not thou put forth thy specious pleas and clever words to me now, for one word of mine will lay thee low. Hadst thou not had a villain’s heart, thou shouldst have gained my consent, then made this match, instead of hiding it from those who loved thee. Thou wouldest have lent me ready aid, no doubt, in this proposal, if I had told thee of my marriage, seeing that not even now canst thou restrain thy soul’s hot fury. This was not what restrained thee; but thine eye was turned towards old age, and a foreign wife began to appear discreditable to thee. Be well assured of this: ’twas not for the woman’s sake I wedded the king’s daughter, my present wife; but, as I have already told thee, I wished to insure thy safety and to be the father of royal sons bound by blood to my own children—a bulwark to our house. May that prosperity, whose end is woe, ne’er be mine, nor such wealth as would ever sting my heart! Change that prayer as I will teach thee, and thou wilt show more wisdom. Never let happiness appear in sorrow’s guise, nor, when thy fortune smiles, pretend she frowns! Mock on; thou hast a place of refuge; I am alone, an exile soon to be. Thy own free choice was this; blame no one else. What did I do? Marry, then betray thee? Against the king thou didst invoke an impious curse. On thy house too maybe I bring the curse. Know this, I will no further dispute this point with thee. But, if thou wilt of my fortune somewhat take for the children or thyself to help thy exile, say on; for I am ready to grant it with ungrudging hand, yea and to send tokens to my friends elsewhere who shall treat thee well. If thou refuse this offer, thou wilt do a foolish deed, but if thou cease from anger the greater will be thy gain. I will have naught to do with friends of thine, naught will I receive of thee, offer it not to me; a villain’s gifts can bring no blessing. At least I call the gods to witness, that I am ready in all things to serve thee and thy children, but thou dost scorn my favours and thrustest thy friends stubbornly away; wherefore thy lot will be more bitter still. Away! By love for thy young bride entrapped, too long thou lingerest outside her chamber; go wed, for, if God will, thou shalt have such a marriage as thou wouldst fain refuse. When in excess and past all limits Love doth come, he brings not glory or repute to man; but if the Cyprian queen in moderate might approach, no goddess is so full of charm as she. Never, O never, lady mine, discharge at me from thy golden bow a shaft invincible, in passion’s venom dipped. On me may chastity, heaven’s fairest gift, look never may Cypris, goddess dread, fasten on me a temper to dispute, or restless jealousy, smiting my soul with mad desire for unlawful love, but may she hallow peaceful married life and shrewdly decide whom each of us shall wed. O my country, O my own dear home! God grant I may never be an outcast from my city, leading that cruel helpless life, whose every day is misery. Ere that may I this life complete and yield to death, ay, death; for there is no misery that doth surpass the loss of fatherland. I have seen with mine eyes, nor from the lips of others have I the lesson learnt; no city, not one friend doth pity thee in this thine awful woe. May he perish and find no favour, whoso hath not in him honour for his friends, freely unlocking his heart to them. Never shall he be friend of mine. All hail, Medea! no man knoweth fairer prelude to the greeting of friends than this. All hail to thee likewise, Aegeus, son of wise Pandion. Whence comest thou to this land? From Phoebus’ ancient oracle. What took thee on thy travels to the prophetic centre of the earth? The wish to ask how I might raise up seed unto myself. Pray tell me, hast thou till now dragged on a childless life? I have no child owing to the visitation of some god. Hast thou a wife, or hast thou never known the married state? I have a wife joined to me in wedlock’s bond. What said Phoebus to thee as to children? Words too subtle for man to comprehend. Surely I may learn the god’s answer? Most assuredly, for it is just thy subtle wit it needs. What said the god? speak, if I may hear it. He bade me Till when? what must thou do first, what country visit? Till I to my native home return. What object hast thou in sailing to this land? O’er Troezen’s realm is Pittheus king. Pelops’ son, a man devout they say. To him I fain would impart the oracle of the god. The man is shrewd and versed in such-like lore. Aye, and to me the dearest of all my warrior friends. Good luck to thee! success to all thy wishes! But why that downcast eye, that wasted cheek? O Aegeus, my husband has proved a monster of iniquity. What meanest thou? explain to me clearly the cause of thy despondency. Jason is wronging me though I have given him no cause. What hath he done? tell me more clearly. He is taking another wife to succeed me as mistress of his house. Can he have brought himself to such a dastard deed? Be assured thereof; I, whom he loved of yore, am in dishonour now. Hath he found a new love? or does he loathe thy bed? Much in love is he! A traitor to his friend is he become. Enough! if he is a villain as thou sayest. The alliance he is so much enamoured of is with a princess. Who gives his daughter to him? go on, I pray. Creon, who is lord of this land of Corinth. Lady, I can well pardon thy grief. I am undone, and more than that, am banished from the land. By whom? fresh woe this word of thine unfolds. Creon drives me forth in exile from Corinth. Doth Jason allow it? This too I blame him for. Not in words, but he will not stand out against it. Ο, I implore thee by this beard and by thy knees, in suppliant posture, pity, O pity my sorrows; do not see me cast forth forlorn, but receive me in thy country, to a seat within thy halls. So may thy wish by heaven’s grace be crowned with a full harvest of offspring, and may thy life close in happiness! Thou knowest not the rare good luck thou findest here, for I will make thy childlessness to cease and cause thee to beget fair issue; so potent are the spells I know. Lady, on many grounds I am most fain to grant thee this thy boon, first for the gods’ sake, next for the children whom thou dost promise I shall beget; for in respect of this I am completely lost. Only one warning I do give thee first, lady; I will not from this land bear thee away, yet if of thyself thou reach my halls, there shalt thou bide in safety and I will never yield thee up to any man. But from for I have no wish to incur the blame of my allies as well. It shall be even so; but wouldst thou pledge thy word to this, I should in all be well content with thee. Surely thou dost trust me? or is there aught that troubles thee? Thee I trust; but Pelias’ house and Creon are my foes. Wherefore, if thou art bound by an oath, thou wilt not give whilst they have wealth and a princely house. Lady, thy words show much foresight, so if this is thy will, I do not refuse. For I shall feel secure and safe if I have some pretext to offer to thy foes, and thy case too the firmer stands. Now name thy gods. Swear by the plain of Earth, by Helios my father’s sire, and, in one comprehensive oath, by all the race of gods. What shall I swear to do, from what refrain? tell me that. Swear that thou wilt never of thyself expel me from thy land, nor, whilst life is thine, permit any other, one of my foes maybe, to hale me thence if so he will. By earth I swear, by the sun-god’s holy beam and by all the host of heaven that I will stand fast to the terms, I hear thee make. ’Tis enough. If thou shouldst break this oath, what curse dost thou invoke upon thyself? Whate’er betides the impious. Go in peace; all is well, and I with what speed I may, will to thy city come, when I have wrought my purpose and obtained my wish. May Maia’s princely son go with thee on thy way to bring thee to thy home, and mayest thou attain that on which thy soul is set so firmly, for to my mind thou seemest a generous man, O Aegeus. O Zeus, and Justice, child of Zeus, and sun-god’s light, now will I triumph o’er my foes, kind friends; on victory’s road have I set forth; good hope have I of wreaking vengeance on those I hate. For where we were in most distress this stranger hath appeared, to be a haven in my counsels; to him will we make fast the cables of our ship when we come to the town and citadel of Pallas. But now will I explain to thee my plans in full; do not expect to hear a pleasant tale. A servant of mine will I to Jason send and crave an interview; then when he comes I will address him with soft words, say, then will I entreat that here my children may abide, not that I mean to leave them in a hostile land for foes to flout, but that I may slay the king’s daughter by guile. For I will send them with gifts in their hands, carrying them unto the bride to save them from banishment, a robe of finest woof and a chaplet of gold. And if these ornaments she take and put them on, miserably shall she die, and likewise everyone who touches her; And here I quit this theme; but I shudder at the deed I must do next; for I will slay the children I have borne; there is none shall take them from my toils; and when I have utterly confounded Jason’s house I will leave the land, escaping punishment for my dear children’s murder, after my most unholy deed. For I cannot endure the taunts of enemies, kind friends; enough! what gain is life to me? I have no country, home, or refuge left. Ο, I did wrong, that hour I left my father’s home, persuaded by that Hellene’s words, who now shall pay the penalty, so help me God. Never shall he see again alive the children I bore to him, nor from his new bride shall he beget issue, for she must die a hideous death, slain by my drugs. Let no one deem me a poor weak woman who sits with folded hands, but of another mould, dangerous to foes and well-disposed to friends; for they win the fairest fame who live their life like me. Since thou hast imparted this design to me, I bid thee hold thy hand, both from a wish to serve thee and because I would uphold the laws men make. It cannot but be so; thy words I pardon since thou art not in the same sorry plight that I am. O lady, wilt thou steel thyself to slay thy children twain? I will, for that will stab my husband to the heart. It may, but thou wilt be the saddest wife alive. No matter; wasted is every word that comes ’twixt now and then.  Sons of Erechtheus, heroes happy from of yore, children of the blessed gods, fed on wisdom’s glorious food in a holy land ne’er pillaged by its foes, ye who move with sprightly step through a climate ever bright and clear, and poets sing how Cypris drawing water from the streams of fair-flowing Cephissus breathes of balmy winds, and ever as she crowns her tresses with a garland of sweet rose-buds sends forth the Loves to sit by wisdom’s side, to take a part in every excellence. How then shall the city of sacred streams, the land that welcomes those it loves, receive thee, the murderess of thy children, thee whose presence with others is a pollution? Think on the murder of thy children, consider the bloody deed thou takest on thee. Nay, by thy knees we, one and all, implore thee, slay not thy babes. Where How wilt thou look upon thy babes, and still without a tear retain thy bloody purpose? Thou canst not, when they fall at thy feet for mercy, steel thy heart and dip in their blood thy hand. I am come at thy bidding, for e’en though thy hate for me is bitter thou shalt not fail in this small boon, but I will hear what new request thou hast to make of me, lady. Jason, I crave thy pardon for the words I spoke, and well thou mayest brook my burst of passion, for ere now we twain have shared much love. For I have reasoned with my soul and railed upon me thus, this connexion for us; but I was mad, I who should have shared in these designs, helped on thy plans, and lent my aid to bring about the match, only too pleased to wait upon thy bride. But what we are, we are, we women, evil I will not say; wherefore thou shouldst not sink to our sorry level nor with our weapons meet our childishness. I yield and do confess that I was wrong then, but now have I come to a better mind. Come hither, my children, come, leave the house, step forth, and with me greet and bid farewell to your father, be reconciled from all past bitterness unto your friends, as now your mother is; for we have made a truce and anger is no more. when I reflect, as now, upon the hidden future. O my children, since there awaits you even thus a long, long life, stretch forth the hand to take a fond farewell. Ah me! how new I let the tear-drops stream adown my tender cheek. From my eyes too bursts forth the copious tear; O, may no greater ill than the present e’er befall! Lady, I praise this conduct, not that I blame what is past; for it is but natural to the female sex to vent their spleen against a husband when he trafficks in other marriages with all good heed a sure refuge, by God’s grace; for ye, I trow, shall with your brothers share hereafter the foremost rank in this Corinthian realm. Only grow up, for all the rest your sire and whoso of the gods is kind to us is bringing to pass. May I see you reach man’s full estate, high o’er the heads of those I hate! But thou, lady, why with fresh tears dost thou thine eyelids wet, turning away thy wan cheek, with no welcome for these my happy tidings? ’Tis naught; upon these children my thoughts were turned. Then take heart; for I will see that it is well with them. I will do so; nor will I doubt thy word; woman is a weak creature, ever given to tears. Why prithee, unhappy one, dost moan o’er these children? I gave them birth; and when thou didst pray long life for them, pity entered into my soul to think that these things must be. But the reason of thy coming hither to speak with me is partly told, the rest will I now mention. Since it is the pleasure of the rulers of the land to banish me, and well I know ’twere best for me to stand not in the way of thee or of the rulers by dwelling here, enemy as I am thought unto their house, forth from this land in exile am I going, but these children,—that they may know thy fostering hand, beg Creon to remit their banishment I doubt whether I can persuade him, yet must I attempt it. At least do thou bid thy wife ask her sire this boon, to remit the exile of the children from this land. Yea, that will I; and her methinks I shall persuade, since she is a woman like the rest. I too will aid thee in this task, for by the children’s hand I will send to her gifts that far surpass in beauty, I well know, aught that now is seen ’mongst men, a robe of finest tissue and a chaplet of chased gold. But one of my attendants must haste and bring the ornaments hither. Happy shall she be not once alone but ten thousandfold, for in thee she wins the noblest soul to share her love, and gets these gifts as well which on a day my father’s sire, the Sun-god, bestowed on his descendants. My children, take in your hands these wedding gifts, and bear them as an offering to the royal maid, the happy bride; for verily the gifts she shall receive are not to be scorned. But why so rashly rob thyself of these gifts? Dost think a royal palace wants for robes or gold? Keep them, nor give them to another. For well I know that if my lady hold me in esteem, she will set my price above all wealth. Say not so; ’tis said that gifts tempt even gods; and o’er men’s minds gold holds more potent sway than countless words. Fortune smiles upon thy bride, and heaven now doth swell her triumph; youth is hers and princely power; yet to save my children from exile I would barter life, not dross alone. Children, when ye are come to the rich palace, pray your father’s new bride, my mistress, with suppliant voice to save you from exile, offering her these ornaments the while; for it is most needful that she receive the gifts in her own hand. Now go and linger not; may ye succeed and to your mother bring back the glad tidings she fain would hear! Gone, gone is every hope I had that the children yet might live; forth to their doom they now proceed. The hapless bride will take, ay, take the golden crown that is to with her own hand will she lift and place upon her golden locks the garniture of death. Its grace and sheen divine will tempt her to put on the robe and crown of gold, and in that act will she deck herself to be a bride amid the dead. Such is the snare whereinto she will fall, such is the deadly doom that waits the hapless maid, nor shall she from the curse escape. And thou, poor wretch, who to thy sorrow art wedding a king’s daughter, little thinkest of the doom thou art bringing on thy children’s life, or of the cruel death that waits thy bride. Woe is thee! how art thou fallen from thy high estate! Next do I bewail thy sorrows, O mother hapless in thy children, thou who wilt slay thy babes because thou hast a rival, the babes thy husband hath deserted impiously to join him to another bride. Thy children, lady, are from exile freed, and gladly did the royal bride accept thy gifts in her own hands, and so thy children made their peace with her. Ah! Why art so disquieted in thy prosperous hour? Why turnest thou thy cheek away, and hast no welcome for my glad news? Ah me! These groans but ill accord with the news I bring. Ah me! once more I say. Have I unwittingly announced some evil tidings? Have I erred in thinking my news was good? Thy news is as it is; I blame thee not. Then why this downcast eye, these floods of tears? Old friend, needs must I weep; for the gods and I with fell intent devised these schemes. Be of good cheer; thou too of a surety shalt by thy sons yet be brought home again. Ere that shall I bring others to their home, ah! woe is me! Thou art not the only mother from thy children reft. Bear patiently thy troubles as a mortal must. I will obey; go thou within the house and make the day’s provision for the children. O my babes, my babes, ye have still a city and a home, where far from me and my sad lot you will live your lives, reft of your mother for ever; while I must to another land in banishment, or ever I have had my joy of you, or lived to see you happy, or ever I have graced your marriage couch, your bride, your bridal bower, or lifted high the wedding torch. Ah me! a victim of my own self-will. So it was all in vain I reared you, O my sons; in vain did suffer, racked with anguish, enduring the cruel pangs of childbirth. ’Fore Heaven I once had hope, poor me! high hope of ye that you would nurse me in my age and deck my corpse with loving hands, a boon we mortals covet; but now is my sweet fancy dead and gone; for I must lose you both and in bitterness and sorrow drag through life. And ye shall never with fond eyes see your mother more, for o’er your life there comes a change. Ah me! ah me! why do ye look at me so, my children? why smile that last sweet smile? Ah me! what am I to do? My heart gives way when I behold my children’s laughing eyes. Ο, I cannot; farewell to all my former schemes; I will take the children from the land, the babes I bore. Why should I wound their sire by wounding them, and get me a twofold measure of sorrow? No, no, I will not do it. Farewell my scheming! And yet what am I coming to? Can I consent to let those foes of mine escape from punishment, and incur their mockery? I must face this deed. Out upon my craven heart! to think that I should even have let the soft must see to it himself; I will not spoil my never, never will I hand my children over to their foes to mock and flout. Die they must in any case, and since ’tis so, why I, the mother who bore them, will give the fatal blow. In any case their doom is fixed and there is no escape. Already the crown is on her head, the robe is round her, and she is dying, the royal bride; that do I know full well. But now since I have a piteous path to tread, and yet more piteous still the path I send my children on, fain would I say farewell to them. O my babes, my babes, let your mother kiss your hands. Ah! hands I love so well, O lips most dear to me! O noble form and features of my children, I wish ye joy, but in that other land, for here your father robs you of your home. O the sweet embrace, the soft young cheek, the fragrant breath! my children! Go, leave me; I cannot bear to longer look upon ye; my sorrow wins the day. At last I understand the awful deed I am to do; but passion, that cause of direst woes to mortal man, hath triumphed o’er my sober thoughts. Oft ere now have I pursued subtler themes and have faced graver issues than woman’s sex should seek to probe; but then e’en we aspire to culture, which dwells with us to teach us wisdom; I say not all; for small is the class amongst women—(one maybe shalt thou find ’mid many)— that is not incapable of culture. And amongst mortals I do assert that they who are wholly without experience and have never had children far surpass in happiness those who are parents. The childless, because they have never proved whether children grow up to be a blessing or curse to men are removed from all share in many troubles; whilst those who have a sweet race of children growing up in their houses do wear away, as I perceive, their whole life through; But one last crowning woe for every mortal man I now will name; suppose that they have found sufficient means to live, and seen their children grow to man’s estate and walk in virtue’s path, still if fortune so befall, a grief surpassing all? Kind friends, long have I waited expectantly to know how things would at the palace chance. And lo! I see one of Jason’s servants coming hither, whose hurried gasps for breath proclaim him the bearer of some fresh tidings. Fly, fly, Medea! who hast wrought an awful deed, transgressing every law; nor leave behind or sea-borne bark or car that scours the plain. Why, what hath chanced that calls for such a flight of mine? The princess is dead, a moment gone, and Creon too, her sire, slain by those drugs of thine. Tidings most fair are thine! Henceforth shalt thou be ranked amongst my friends and benefactors. Ha! What? Art sane? Art not distraught, lady, who hearest with joy the outrage to our royal house done, and art not at the horrid tale afraid? Somewhat have I, too, to say in answer to thy words. Be not so hasty, friend, but tell the manner of their death, for thou wouldst give me double joy, if so they perished miserably. When the children twain whom thou didst bear that thou and thy lord had made up your former quarrel. One kissed thy children’s hands, another their golden hair, while I for very joy went with them in person to the women’s chambers. Our mistress, whom now we do revere in thy room, cast a longing glance at Jason, ere she saw thy children twain; but then she veiled her eyes and turned her blanching cheek away, disgusted at their coming; but thy husband tried to check his young bride’s angry humour with these words: and set the golden crown about her tresses, arranging her hair at her bright mirror, with many a happy smile at her breathless counterfeit. Then rising from her seat she passed across the chamber, tripping lightly on her fair white foot, exulting in the gift, with many a glance at her uplifted ankle. and sinks upon a seat scarce soon enough to save herself from falling to the ground. An aged dame, one of her company, thinking belike it was a fit from Pan rolling in their sockets, and all the blood her and the whole house echoed with their running to and fro. By this time would a quick walker have made the turn in a course of six plethra for against her a twofold anguish was warring. The chaplet of gold about her head was sending forth a wondrous stream of ravening flame, while the fine raiment, thy children’s gift, was preying on the hapless maiden’s fair white flesh; and she starts from her seat in a blaze and seeks to fly, shaking her hair and head this way and that, to cast the crown therefrom; but the gold held firm to its fastenings, and the flame, as she shook her locks, blazed forth the more with double fury. Then to the earth she sinks, by the cruel blow o’ercome, past all recognition now save to a father’s eye; for her eyes had lost their tranquil gaze, her face no more its natural look preserved, and from the crown of her head blood and fire in mingled stream ran down; and from her bones the flesh kept peeling off beneath the gnawing of those secret drugs, e’en as when the pine-tree weeps its tears of pitch, a fearsome sight to see. And all were afraid to touch the corpse, for we were warned by what had chanced. Anon came her hapless father unto the house, all unwitting of her doom, and stumbles o’er the dead, and loud he cried, and folding his arms about her kissed her, with words like these the while, He strove to rise, but she still held him back; and if ever he pulled with all his might, from off his bones his aged flesh he tore. At last he gave it up, and breathed forth his soul in awful suffering; for he could no longer master the pain. So there they lie, daughter and aged sire, dead side by side, a grievous sight that calls for tears. And as for thee, I leave thee out of my consideration, for thyself must discover a means to escape punishment. Not now for the first time I think this human life a shadow; yea, and without shrinking I will say that they amongst men who pretend to wisdom and expend deep thought on words do incur a serious charge of folly; for amongst mortals no man is happy; wealth may pour in and make one luckier than another, but none can happy be. This day the deity, it seems, will mass on Jason, as he well deserves, a heavy load of evils. Woe is thee, daughter of Creon! We pity thy sad fate, gone as thou art to Hades’ halls as the price of thy marriage with Jason. My friends, I am resolved upon the deed; at once will I slay my children and then leave this land, without delaying long enough to hand them over to some more savage hand to butcher. Needs must they die in any case; and since they must, I will slay them—I, the mother that bare them. O heart of mine, steel thyself! Why do I hesitate to do the awful deed that must be done? Come, take the sword, thou wretched hand of mine! Take it, and advance to the post whence starts thy life of sorrow! Away with cowardice! Give not one thought to thy babes, they were thy darlings still, and O earth, O sun whose beam illumines all, look, look upon this lost woman, ere she stretch forth, her murderous hand upon her sons for blood; for lo! these are scions of thy own golden seed, and the blood of gods is in danger of being shed by man. O light, from Zeus proceeding, stay her, hold her hand, forth from the house chase this fell bloody fiend by demons led. Vainly wasted were the throes thy children cost thee; vainly hast thou born, it seems, sweet babes, O thou who hast left behind thee that passage through the blue Symplegades, that strangers justly hate. Ah! hapless one, why doth fierce anger thy soul assail? Why woes to suit each crime hurled from heaven on the murderer’s house. Didst hear, didst hear the children’s cry? O lady, born to sorrow, victim of an evil fate!   Shall I enter the house? For the children’s sake I am resolved to ward off the murder.   O hapless mother, surely thou hast a heart of stone or steel to slay the offspring of thy womb by such a murderous doom. Of all the wives of yore I know but one who laid her hand upon her children dear, even Ino, that the wife of Zeus drove her wandering from her home. But she, poor sufferer, flung herself into the sea because of the foul murder of her children, leaping o’er the wave-beat cliff, and in her death was she united to her children twain. Can there be any deed of horror left to follow this? Woe for the wooing of women fraught with disaster! What sorrows hast thou caused for men ere now! Ladies, stationed near this house, pray tell me is the author of these hideous deeds, Medea, still within, or hath she fled from hence? For she must hide beneath the earth or soar on wings towards heaven’s vault, if she would avoid the vengeance of the royal house. Is she so sure she will escape herself unpunished from this house, when she hath slain the rulers of the land? But enough of this! I am forgetting her children. As for her, those whom she hath wronged will do the like by her; but I am come to save the children’s life, lest the victim’s kin visit their wrath on me, in vengeance for the murder foul, wrought by my children’s mother. Unhappy man, thou knowest not the full extent of thy misery, else had thou never said those words. How now? Can she want to kill me too? Thy sons are dead; slain by their own mother’s hand. O God! what sayest thou? Woman, thou hast sealed my doom. Thy children are no more; be sure of this. Where slew she them; within the palace or outside? Throw wide the doors and see thy children’s murdered corpses. Haste, ye slaves, loose the bolts, undo the fastenings, that I may see the sight of twofold woe, my murdered sons and her, whose blood in vengeance I will shed. Why shake those doors and attempt to loose their bolts, in quest of the dead and me their murderess? From such toil desist. If thou wouldst aught with me, say on, if so thou wilt; but never shalt thou lay hand on me, so swift the steeds the sun, my father’s sire, to me doth give to save me from the hand of my foes. Accursed woman! by gods, by me and all mankind abhorred as never woman was, who hadst the heart to stab thy babes, thou their mother, leaving me undone and childless; this hast thou done and still dost gaze upon the sun and earth after this deed most impious. Curses on thee! I now perceive what then I missed in the day I brought thee, fraught with doom, from thy home in a barbarian land to dwell in Hellas, traitress to thy sire and to the land that nurtured thee. On me the gods have hurled the curse that dogged thy steps, for thou didst slay thy brother at his hearth ere thou cam’st aboard our fair ship this deed; yet before them all I chose thee for my wife, wedding a foe to be my doom, no woman, but a lioness fiercer than Tyrrhene Scylla in I cannot wound thee, so brazen is thy nature. Perish, vile sorceress, murderess of thy babes! Whilst I must mourn my luckless fate, for I shall ne’er enjoy my new-found bride, nor shall I have the children, whom I bred and reared, alive to say the last farewell to me; nay, I have lost them. To this thy speech I could have made a long retort, but Father Zeus knows well all I have done for thee, and the treatment thou hast given me. Yet thou wert not ordained to scorn my love and lead a life of joy in mockery of me, nor was thy royal bride nor Creon, who gave thee a second wife, to thrust me from this land and rue it not. Wherefore, if thou wilt, call me e’en a lioness, and Scylla, whose home is in the Tyrrhene land; for I in turn have wrung thy heart, as well I might. Thou, too, art grieved thyself, and sharest in my sorrow. Be well assured I am; but it relieves my pain to know thou canst not mock at me. O my children, how vile a mother ye have found! My sons, your father’s feeble lust has been your ruin! ’Twas not my hand, at any rate, that slew them. No, but thy foul treatment of me, and thy new marriage. Didst think that marriage cause enough to murder them? Dost think a woman counts this a trifling injury? So she be self-restrained; but in thy eyes all is evil. Thy sons are dead and gone. That will stab thy heart. They live, methinks, The gods know, whoso of them began this troublous coil. Indeed, they know that hateful heart of thine. Thou art as hateful. I am aweary of thy bitter tongue. And I likewise of thine. But parting is easy. Say how; what am I to do? for I am fain as thou to go. Give up to me those dead, to bury and lament No, never! I will bury them myself, bearing them to Hera’s sacred field, who watches o’er the Cape, that none of their foes may insult them by pulling down their tombs; and in this land of Sisyphus I will ordain hereafter a solemn feast and mystic rites to atone for this impious murder. Myself will now to the land of Erechtheus, to dwell with Aegeus, Pandion’s son. But thou, as well thou mayest, shalt die a caitiff’s death, thy head The curse of our sons’ avenging spirit and of Justice, that calls for blood, be on thee! What god or power divine hears thee, breaker of oaths and every law of hospitality? Fie upon thee! cursed witch! child-murderess! To thy house! go, bury thy wife. I go, bereft of both my sons. Thy grief is yet to come; wait till old age is with thee too. O my dear, dear children! Dear to their mother, not to thee. And yet thou didst slay them? Yea, to vex thy heart. One last fond kiss, ah me! I fain would on their lips imprint. Embraces now, and fond farewells for them; but then a cold repulse! By heaven I do adjure thee, let me touch their tender skin. No, no! in vain this word has sped its flight. O Zeus, dost hear how I am driven hence; dost mark the treatment I receive from this she-lion, fell murderess of her young? Yet so far as I may and can, I raise for them a dirge, and do adjure Many a fate doth Zeus dispense, high on his Olympian throne; oft do the gods bring things to pass beyond man’s expectation; that, which we thought would be, is not fulfilled, while for the unlooked-for god finds out a way; and such hath been the issue of this matter.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    My children, latest-born wards of old Cadmus, why do you sit before me like this with wreathed branches of suppliants, while the city reeks with incense, rings with prayers for health and cries of woe?  I thought it unbefitting, my children, to hear these things from the mouths of others, and have come here myself, I, Oedipus renowned by all.  Tell me, then, venerable old man—since it is proper that you speak for these—in what mood you sit here, one of fear or of desire?  Be sure that I will gladly give you all my help.  I would be hard-hearted indeed if I did not pity such suppliants as these. Oedipus, ruler of my land, you see the age of those who sit on your altars—some, nestlings still too tender for flight, others, bowed with age, priests, like me of Zeus, and some, these here, the chosen youth.  The rest of the folk sit with wreathed branches in the market-place, and before the shrines of Pallas, and where Ismenus gives answer by fire.  For the city, as you yourself see, is now sorely vexed, and can no longer lift her head from beneath the angry waves of death. A blight has fallen on the fruitful blossoms of the land, the herds among the pastures, the barren pangs of women.  And the flaming god, the malign plague, has swooped upon us, and ravages the town: he lays waste to the house of Cadmus, but enriches Hades with groans and tears. It is not because we rank you with the gods that I and these children\\n                     are suppliants at your hearth, but because we deem you the first among men in\\n                     life’s common fortunes and in dealings with the divinities: when you came to the city of the Cadmeans, you freed us from the tax that we rendered to the hard songstress, and that when you knew no more than anyone else, nor had you been taught, but rather by the assistance of a god, as the story goes, you uplifted our life. Now, Oedipus, king glorious in our eyes, we, your suppliants, beseech you to find some defence for us, whether you hear it from some divine omen, or learn of it from some mortal.  For I see that the outcome of the councils of experienced men most often have effect.  On, best of mortals, uplift our state! On, guard your fame, since now this land calls you savior on account of your former zeal.  Let us not remember of your reign that we were first restored and then cast down: lift this state so that it falls no more!  With good omen you provided us that past happiness: show yourself the same now too, since if you are to rule this land just as you do now, it is better to be lord of men than of a wasteland. Neither walled town nor ship is anything, if it is empty and no men dwell within. My piteous children, I know quite well the desires with which you have come: I know well that you all are sick, and though you are sick I know well that there is not one of you who is as sick as I.  Your pain comes on each of you for himself alone, and for no other, but my soul is in pain at once for the city, for myself, and for you. Thus you are not awakening me from sleep: no, be sure that I have wept many tears, wandered far and wide in my thought.  I have made use of the only remedy which I could find after close consideration: I sent my relative Creon, Menoeceus’ son, to Apollo’s Pythian residence to learn what we might do or say to\\n                     protect this city. And now, when the lapse of days is reckoned, I am troubled\\n                     about what he is doing, for he has been away an unreasonably long time beyond what is fitting.  But when he arrives, I would be no true man if did not perform all that the god reveals. You have spoken opportunely, since at this time these people here indicate that Creon is drawing near. Lord Apollo, may he come to us in the brightness of saving fortune, even as his face is bright! He seems to bring comfort, since otherwise he would not be coming crowned so thickly with berry-laden bay. We will soon know: he is within hearing-range. Prince, my kinsman, child of Menoeceus, what news have you brought us from the god? Good news.  I tell you that even troubles hard to bear will end in perfect peace if they  find the right issue. But what is the oracle ?  So far, your words neither encourage nor frighten me. If you want to hear in the presence of these people, I am ready to speak: otherwise we can go inside. Speak to all.  The sorrow that I bear for these is more than for my own life. I will tell you what I heard from the god. Phoebus our lord clearly commands us to drive out the defilement which he said was harbored in this land, and not to nourish it so that it cannot be healed. With what sort of purification? What is the manner of the misfortune? By banishing the man, or by paying back bloodshed with bloodshed, since it is this blood which brings the tempest on our city. And who is the man whose fate he thus reveals? Laius, my lord, was the leader of our land before you assumed control of this state. I know it well—by hearsay, for I never saw him. He was slain, and the god now bids us to take vengeance on his murderers, whoever they are. Where on earth are they? Where shall the dim track of this old crime be found? In this land, the god said.  What is sought for can be caught; only that which is not watched escapes. Was it in the house, or in the field, or on foreign soil that Laius met his bloody end? He left our land, as he said, on a mission to And once he had set forth, he never again returned. And was there none to tell? Was there no travelling companion who saw the deed, from whom tidings might have been gained, and used? All perished, save one who fled in fear, and he could tell with assurance only one thing of all that he saw. And what was that?  One thing might hold the clue to many, if we could only get a small beginning for hope. He said that robbers fell upon them, not one man alone, but with a great force. How then, unless some intrigue had been worked with bribes from here in Such things were surmised.  But once Laius was slain no avenger arose in the midst of our troubles. But when royalty had fallen in this way, what trouble prevented a full search? The riddling Sphinx had forced us to let things that were obscure go, and to investigate the pressing trouble. I will start afresh, and once more make dark things plain.   Worthily has Phoebus Apollo—and worthily have you—bestowed this care on behalf of the dead.  And so, as is fitting, you will find me allied with you in seeking vengeance for this land, and for the god as well.  I will dispel this taint not on behalf of far-off friends, but for my own benefit.  For whoever killed Laius might wish to take vengeance on me also with a hand as fierce. Avenging Laius, therefore,\\n                     I serve myself. Come, my children, as quickly as possible rise from the\\n                     altar-steps, and lift these suppliant boughs. Let someone summon here Cadmus’\\n                     people, warning them that I will leave nothing untried. For with the god’s help our good fortune—or our ruin—will be made certain. My children, let us rise.  What we came to seek, this man promises of his own accord.  And may Phoebus, who sent these oracles, come to us as savior and deliverer from the pestilence. O sweetly-speaking  message of Zeus, in what spirit have you come to glorious in holy fear of you, wondering what debt you will extract from me, perhaps unknown before, perhaps renewed with the revolving years.  Tell me, immortal Voice, child of golden Hope. First I call on you, daughter of Zeus, immortal Athena, and on your sister, Artemis, guardian of our earth, who sits on her glorious throne above the circle of our market-place, and on far-shooting Apollo: oh shine forth for me, my three-fold help against death! If ever before you drove a fiery pest from our borders to stop ruin rushing upon our city, come now also! Alas, countless are the sorrows I bear. A plague is on all our people, and thought can find no weapon for defense.  The fruits of the glorious earth do not grow; by no birth of offspring do women surmount the pangs in which they shriek. You can see life after life speed away, like a bird on the wing, swifter than irresistible fire, to the shore of the western god. With such deaths, past numbering, the city perishes. Unpitied, her children lie on the ground, spreading pestilence, with no one to mourn them.  Meanwhile young wives and grey-haired mothers raise a wail at the steps of the altars, some here, some there, and groan in supplication for their terrible woes.  The prayers to the Healer ring clear, and with them the voice of lamentation.  For which things, golden daughter of Zeus, send us the bright face of comfort. Grant that the fierce god of death, who now without the bronze of shields, though among cries like those of battle, wraps me in the flames of his onset, may turn his back in speedy flight from our land, borne by a favorable wind to the great chamber of Amphitrite, or to the Thracian waves, those waters where none find haven.  For if night leaves anything undone in the working of destruction, day follows to accomplish it.  You who wield the powers of fiery lightning, Zeus our father, slay him beneath your thunder-bolt. Lycean Lord, would that the shafts from your bent bow’s string of woven\\n                        gold might go forth in their might, our champions in the face of the foe, and the flashing fires of Artemis too, with which she darts through the Lycian hills.  I call him whose locks are bound with gold, who is named with the name of this land, ruddy Bacchus to whom Bacchants cry, to draw near with the blaze of his shining torch, our ally against the god unhonored among the gods. You pray.  And in answer to your prayer, if you will give a loyal reception to my words and minister to your own disease, you may hope to find help and relief from woes.  These words I will speak publicly, as one who was a stranger to the report, a stranger to the deed.  I would not go far on the trail if I were tracing it alone, without a clue.  But as it is—since it was only after the event that I was counted a Theban among Thebans—to you, Cadmeans all, I do thus proclaim: Whoever knows by whom Laius son of Labdacus was slain, I order him to declare all to me.  And if he is afraid, I order him to remove the danger of indictment from his path by denouncing himself: he will suffer no other punishment, but will only leave this land, unhurt. If anyone knows the assassin to be an alien, from another land, let him not keep silent.  I will reward him, and my thanks shall rest with him besides.  But if he keeps silent, if anyone, through fear, seeks to screen himself or a friend from my orders, then hear what I shall do:  I charge you that no resident of this land, which I rule, give shelter to or address that murderer, whoever he is, or make him a partner in prayer or sacrifice, or give him a share of the lustral rite.  Ban him from your houses, all of you, knowing that this is the defilement, as the oracle of the Pythian god has recently shown to me.  In this way I am an ally both to the god and to the dead man.  And I pray solemnly that the slayer, whoever he is, whether he alone is guilty or he has partners, may, in the horrible way he deserves, wear out his unblest life. And for myself I pray that if he should, with my knowledge, become a resident of my house, I may suffer the same things which I have just called down on others.  And I order you to make all these words good, for my sake, for the sake of the god, and for the sake of our land, thus rendered unfruitful and ungodly. For even if the matter had not been urged upon us by a god,\\nit still would not have been fit that you should leave the guilt unpunished as it is, when one so noble—and he your king—had perished.  You should have searched it out.  But now, since I hold the powers which he once held, possessing his bed and the wife who bore his children, and since, had his hope of offspring not been unsuccessful, children born of one mother would have tied us with a common bond—as it was, fate swooped upon his head—I will uphold this cause, as though it were that of my own father, and will leave no stone unturned in my search for the one who shed the blood, for the honor of the son of Labdacus and of Polydorus and the elder Cadmus and Agenor of old. send them neither harvest of the earth nor fruit of the womb, but that they perish with the present fate, or one still worse.  But to all you, the loyal Cadmeans who are satisfied by these things, may justice, our ally, and all the gods be gracious always. As you have put me under oath, on my oath, my king, I will speak.  I am not the slayer, nor can I reveal him.  As for the investigation, it was for Phoebus, who enjoined it, to tell us who did the deed. Justly said.  But no man on earth can force the gods to do what they do not want. I would like to say what seems to me the next best course. And if there is a third course, do not hesitate to reveal it too. I know that our lord Teiresias is the seer most like our lord Apollo: from him, my king, an investigator might learn most clearly about these affairs. Not even this have I neglected. On Creon’s suggestion, I sent a man twice\\n                     to bring him. And I have been wondering for some time why he is not here. Indeed—his skill apart—the rumors are but faint and old. What are the rumors?  I am investigating every tale. He was said to have been killed by some wayfarers. I too have heard that.  But no one sees the one who saw it. If he knows what fear is, he will not hesitate to come forward when he hears your curses, so dire are they. When a man does not shrink from a deed, he is not scared by a word. But there is one to convict him.  But here they bring at last the godlike prophet, the only man in whom truth lives. Teiresias, whose soul grasps all things, both that which may be told and that which is unspeakable, the Olympian secrets and the affairs of the earth, you feel, though you cannot see, what a huge plague haunts our state.  From which, great prophet, we find you to be our protector and only savior. Now, Phoebus—if indeed you have not already heard the news—sent answer to our question that the only way to rid ourselves of this pest that afflicts us is to discover the slayers of Laius, and then to slay them or banish them from our land. So do not begrudge us the voice of the birds or any other path of prophecy, but save\\n                     yourself and your state, save me, save all that is defiled by the dead. We are\\n                     in your hands, and man’s noblest task is to help others to the best of his means and powers. Alas, how terrible it is to have wisdom when it does not benefit those who have it.  I knew this well, but let it slip from my mind: otherwise I would not have come here. What now? How disheartened you have come! Let me go home.  For you will bear your own burden to the end, and I will bear mine, if you consent. Your words are strange and unkind to the state which nurtured you, since you withhold this response. I see that you, for your part, speak inappropriately. Therefore do not speak, so I will not suffer the same. For the love of the gods, do not turn away, if you have knowledge: all we suppliants implore you on our knees. For all of you are without knowledge.  But never will I reveal my troubles—not to call them yours. What are you saying? Do you know the secret and refuse to tell it? Will you betray and destroy the state? I will grieve neither myself nor you.  Why do you ask these things in vain?  You will not learn the answers from me. Will you not, basest of the base— you would anger a stone—speak out?  can nothing touch you? Will you never make an end? You blame my anger, but do not perceive your own: no, you blame me. Who would not be angry hearing such words, with which you now are slighting the city? The future will come of itself, though I shroud it in silence. Since it must come anyway, it is right that you tell it to me. I will speak no further: rage, if you wish, with the fiercest wrath your heart knows. In my anger I will not spare to speak all my thoughts.  Know that you seem to me to have helped in plotting the deed, and to have done it, short of performing the actual murder with your own hands: if you had eyesight, I would have said that you had done even this by yourself. In truth? I order you to abide by you own decree, and from this day forth not to speak to these men or to me: you are the accursed defiler of this land. So brazen with your blustering taunt? Where do you think to escape to? I have escaped.  There is strength in my truth. Who taught you this?  Not your skill, at any rate. You yourself.  For you spurred me on to speak against my will. What did you say? Speak again, so I may learn it better. Did you not understand before, or are you talking to test me? I cannot say I understood fully.  Tell me again. I say that you are the killer of the man whose slayer you seek. Now you will regret that you have said such dire words twice. Should I tell you more, that you might get more angry? Say as much as you want: it will be said in vain. I say that you have been living in unguessed shame with your closest kin, and do not see into what woe you have fallen. Do you think that you will always be able to speak like this without smarting for it? Yes, if indeed there is any strength in truth. But there is, except not for you.  You do not have that strength, since you are maimed in your ears, in your wit, and in your eyes. And you are a poor wretch to utter taunts that every man here will soon hurl at you. Night, endless night has you in her keeping, so that you can never hurt me, or any man that sees the light of the sun. No, it is not your fate to fall at my hands, since Apollo, to whom this matter is a concern, is sufficient. Are these Creon’s devices, or your own? Creon is no trouble for you: you are your own. O wealth, and empire, and skill surpassing skill in life’s keen rivalries, how great is\\n                     the envy in your keeping, if for the sake of this office which the city has\\n                     entrusted to me, a gift unsought, Creon the trustworthy, Creon, my old friend, has crept upon me by stealth, yearning to overthrow me, and has suborned such a scheming juggler as this, a tricky quack, who has eyes only for profit, but is blind in his art! Come, tell me, where have you proved yourself a seer? Why, when the watchful dog who wove\\n                     dark song was here, did you say nothing to free the people? Yet the riddle, at\\n                     least, was not for the first comer to read: there was need of a seer’s\\n                     help, and you were discovered not to have this art, either from birds, or known from some god.  But rather I, Oedipus the ignorant, stopped her, having attained the answer through my wit alone, untaught by birds.  It is I whom you are trying to oust, assuming that you will have great influence in Creon’s court. But I think that you and the one who\\n                     plotted these things will rue your zeal to purge the land: if you did not seem\\n                     to be an old man, you would have learned to your cost how haughty you are. To our way of thinking, these words, both his and yours, Oedipus, have been said in anger.  We have no need of this, but rather we must seek how we shall best discharge the mandates of the god. Though you are king, the right of reply must be considered the same for both: over that I have control. For I do not live as your slave, but as Loxias’. I will not stand enrolled as Creon’s\\n                     client. And I tell you, since you have taunted my blindness, that though you\\n                     have sight, you do not see what a state of misery you are in, or where you\\n                     dwell, or with whom. Do you know who your parents are? You have been an unwitting enemy to your own kin, both\\n                     in the Underworld and on the earth above, and the double lash of your mother’s\\n                     and your father’s curse will one day drive you from this land in dreadful\\n                     haste, with darkness upon those eyes of yours which now can see. What place will be harbor to your cries, what part of all Cithaeron will not ring with them soon, when you have learned the meaning of the nuptials in which, within that house, you found a fatal haven, after a voyage so fair?  And you have not guessed at a throng of other ills which will bring you level with your true self and with your own children.  Therefore heap your scorn upon Creon and upon my message: for no man will ever be crushed more miserably than you. Are these taunts to be endured from him? Be gone, to your ruin; be gone this instant!  Will you not turn your back and leave this house? I would not have come if you had not called me. I did not know you would speak foolishly, for otherwise it would have been a long time before I summoned you to my home. I was born like this—as you think, a fool, but in the opinion of the parents who bore you, quite sane. What parents? Wait.  What man is my father? This day will reveal your birth and bring your ruin. What riddles, what dark words you always say. Are you not the best at unravelling mysteries? Reproach me in what you will find me to be great. Yet it was just that fortune that undid you. But if it saved this city I care not. I will take my leave.  You, boy, lead me. Yes, let him take you: while here, you are a hindrance, a source of trouble.  When you have gone, you will vex me no more. I will go when I have performed the errand for which I came, fearless of your frown: you can never destroy me.  I tell you: the man whom you have been seeking this long while, uttering threats and proclaiming a search into the murder of Laius, is here, ostensibly an alien sojourner, but soon to be found a native of a beggar, though now rich, he will make his way to a foreign land, feeling the ground before him with his staff.  And he will be discovered to be at once brother and father of the children with whom he consorts; son and husband of the woman who bore him; heir to his father’s bed, shedder of his father’s blood. So go in and evaluate this, and\\n                     if you find that I am wrong, say then that I have no wit in prophecy. Who is he of whom the divine voice from the Delphian rock has said to have wrought with blood-red hands horrors that no tongue can tell?  It is time that he ply in flight a foot stronger than the feet of storm-swift steeds. The son of Zeus is springing upon him with fiery lightning, and with him come the dread unerring Fates. Recently the message has flashed forth from snowy ordering all to search for the unknown man.  He wanders under cover of the wild wood, among caves and rocks, fierce as a bull, wretched and forlorn on his joyless path, still seeking to separate himself from the doom revealed at the central shrine of the earth. But that doom lives forever, forever flits around him. The wise augur moves me, neither approving nor denying, with dread, with dread indeed. I am at a loss what to say.  I am flustered in my expectations, seeing neither the present nor the future clearly.  Never in past days or in these have I heard how the house of Labdacus or the son of Polybus had any quarrel with one another that I could bring as proof in assailing the public reputation of Oedipus, seeking to avenge the line of Labdacus for the undiscovered murder. Zeus and Apollo indeed are keen of thought and know the affairs of the earth. But there is no sure test of whether a mortal seer attains more knowledge than I do, though man may surpass man in wisdom.  But until I see the word made good, I will never assent when men blame Oedipus.  Before all eyes the winged maiden came against him once upon a time, and he was seen to be wise, and bore the test in welcome service to the state.  Never, therefore, will he be adjudged guilty of evil. Fellow citizens, having learned that Oedipus the king lays dire charges against me, I have come in indignation. If he thinks that in the present troubles he has suffered from me, by word or by deed, anything harmful, truly I do not desire my full term of years, when I must bear such blame as this.  The wrong of this rumor touches me not in one point alone, but has the largest scope, if I am to be called a traitor in the city, a traitor by you and by my friends. But perhaps this taunt came under the stress of anger, rather than from the purpose of his heart. Was the opinion given that my counsels had brought the seer to utter his falsehoods? Such things were said—I do not know with what meaning. And was this charge laid against me with steady eyes and steady mind? I do not know.  I see not what my masters do.  But here comes our lord from the house. You, how did you get here? Are you so boldfaced that you have come to my house, you who are manifestly the murderer of its master, the palpable thief of its crown?  Come, tell me, in the name of the gods, was it cowardice or folly which you saw in me and which led you to plot this thing?  Did you think that I would not notice this deed of yours creeping upon me by stealth, or that if I became aware of it I would not ward it off? Is your attempt not foolish, to seek the throne without followers or friends—a prize which followers and wealth must win? Mark me now: hear a fair reply in answer to your words, and then judge for yourself on the basis of knowledge. You are apt in speech, but I have a poor wit for lessons, since I have found you a malignant foe. Now hear first how I will explain this very thing. One thing—that you are not false—do not bother to explain to me. If you think that stubbornness without sense is a virtue, you are not wise. If you think you can wrong a kinsman and escape the penalty, you are not sane. Justly said, I grant you: but tell me what the wrong is that you say you are suffering at my hands. Did you, or did you not, advise me to send for that reverend seer? Even now I am of the same mind. How long is it, then, since Laius . . . Did what?  I do not understand. was swept out of sight by deadly violence? The count of years would run far into the past. Did this seer possess this skill in those days? He was wise as now, and held in equal honor. Did he make mention of me at that time? Never, certainly, when I was within hearing. Did you never investigate the murder? Due search we made, of course, though we learned nothing. And how was it that this sage did not tell this story then. I do not know: where I lack insight it is my custom to be silent. This much, at least, you know, and could declare with insight enough. What is that? If I know it, I will not deny it. That, if he had not conferred with you, he would not have named me as\\n                     Laius’ slayer. If he says this, you know best: but I deem it just to learn from you as much as you have from me now. Learn your fill.  I will never be found guilty of the bloodshed. Say, then—have you married my sister? The question allows no denial. And you rule the land as she does, with equal sway. She obtains from me all that she wishes. And do I not rank as a third peer of you two? It is just in this that you are seen to be a false friend. Not so, if you would reason with your heart as I do with mine.  Weigh this first—whether you think that anyone would choose to rule amid terrors rather than in unruffled peace, granted that he is to have the same powers.  Now I, for one, have by nature no yearning to rule as a king rather than to do kingly deeds, and neither does any man I know who has a sound mind. For now I attain all everything from you without fear, but, if I were ruler myself, I would have to do much that went against my own pleasure. that I desire other honors than those which bring profit.  Now, every man has a greeting for me; now, all that have a request of you crave to speak with me, since in me lies all their hope of success.  Why then should I give up these things and take those others? No mind will become false while it is wise.  No, I am no lover of such a policy, and if another put it into action, I could never bear to go along with him.  And, in proof of this, first go to Then next, if you have found that I have planned anything in concert with the soothsayer, take and slay me, by the sentence not of one mouth, but of two—by my own no less than yours.  But do not assume my guilt on unproven inference.  It is not just to judge bad men good at random, or good men bad.  I think that casting off a true friend is for a man like casting away the life in his own bosom, which he most loves.  You will surely learn about these affairs in time, since time alone reveals a just man. But you can discern a bad man even in one day alone. He has spoken well, my king, for one who is taking care not to fall: those who are quick in counsel are not sure. When the stealthy plotter is moving on me quickly, I, too, must be quick in my counterplot. If I await him in repose, his ends will have been gained, and mine lost. What do you want then? To banish me from the land? Hardly.  I desire your death, not your exile, so that I might show what a thing envy is. Are you resolved not to yield or believe? No, for I see you are not sane. Sane, at least, in my own interest. But you should be so in mine also. You are false. But if you understand nothing? Still I must rule. Not if you rule badly. Hear him, city of The city  is mine too, not yours alone. Cease, lords.  In good time I see Iocasta coming from the house, with whose help you should resolve your present feud. Misguided men, why have you raised such a foolish argument?  Are you not ashamed, while the land is so sick, to stir up troubles of your own? Come, go into the house—and you, Creon, go to yours—and stop making so much of a petty grief. Kinswoman, Oedipus, your husband, wants to do one of two terrible things to me, either to thrust me from the land of my fathers or to arrest and slay me. Yes indeed, for I have caught him, lady, working evil against my person with his wicked craft. May I derive no benefit, but perish accursed, if I have done any of the things of which you charge me. In the name of the gods, believe it, Oedipus, first for the sake of this awful oath to the gods, then for my sake and for the sake of those who stand before you. Consent, reflect, listen, my king, I beg you. What would you have me grant you? Respect him who was in the past not foolish, and who now is strong in his oath. Do you understand what you crave? I do. Tell me, then, what you mean. That you should never use an unproved rumor to cast a dishonoring charge on the friend who has bound himself with a curse. Then be quite aware that when you seek this you are seeking death or exile from this land for me. No, by the god that stands at the head of all the host of the gods, no, by the sun.  Unblest, unbefriended, may I die the worst possible death, if I have this thought! But my unhappy soul is worn by the withering of the land, as well as by the thought that our old sorrows should be crowned by new ones arising from the two of you. Then let him go, though I am surely doomed to be killed or thrust dishonored from the land.  Your words, not his, move me to compassion; but he, wherever he be, shall be hated. You are truly sullen in yielding, as you are vehement in the excesses of your wrath.  But such natures are justly most difficult for themselves to bear. Will you not be gone and leave me in peace? I will go on my way.  I have found you undiscerning, but in the view of these men I am just. Lady, why do you hesitate to take this man into the house? I will, when I have learned what has happened. Blind suspicion, bred of talk, arose, and injustice inflicts wounds. On both sides? Yes. And what was the story? It is enough, I think, enough, when our land is already vexed, that the matter should rest where it stopped. Do you see to what you have come, for all your noble intent, in seeking to slacken and blunt my zeal? King, I have said it more than once— be sure that I would have proved myself a madman, bankrupt in sane counsel, if I forsook you—you, who gave a true course to my beloved country when it was distraught with troubles, and who now are likely to prove our prospering guide. In the name of the gods, tell me, king, the reason that you have conceived this steadfast wrath. That I will do, for I honor you, lady, above these men.  Creon is the cause, and the plots he has laid against me. Come, tell me how the argument began. He says that I stand guilty of Laius’ blood. On his own knowledge or on hearsay from another? He has made a rascal seer his mouth piece: as for himself, he keeps his lips wholly pure. Then absolve yourself of the things about which you are speaking.  Listen to me, and take comfort in learning that nothing of mortal birth shares in the science of the seer. I will give you a pithy proof of this.  An oracle came to Laius once—I will not say from Phoebus himself, but from his ministers—saying that he would suffer his doom at the hands of the child to be born to him and me. And Laius—as, at least, the rumor goes—was murdered one day by foreign robbers at a place\\n                     where the three highways meet. And the child’s birth was not yet three days\\n                     past, when Laius pinned his ankles together and had him thrown, by others’\\n                     hands, on a remote mountain. So, in that case, Apollo did not bring it to pass that the child should become the slayer\\n                     of his father, or that Laius should suffer that which he feared, death at the\\n                     hands of his child: thus the messages of the seer’s art had mapped out the\\n                     future. Pay them no regard. Whatever necessary event the god seeks, he himself will easily bring to light. What restlessness of soul, lady, what tumult has come upon me since I heard you speak! What anxiety has startled you, that you say this? I thought that I heard this from you—that Laius was slain where the three roads meet. Yes, that was the report, and so it is still thought. And where is the place where this occurred? The land is called And how much time has passed since these events took place? The news was announced to the town shortly before you first attained power over this land. O Zeus, what have you decreed for me? Why, Oedipus, does this matter weigh upon your heart? Do not ask me yet.  Tell me rather what stature Laius had, and how ripe his manhood was. He was tall—the silver just lightly strewn among his hair—and his form was not greatly unlike your own. Unhappy that I am!  I think that I have laid myself under a terrible curse without realizing it. How do you mean? I tremble when I look at you, my lord. I have dread fears that the seer can see.  But you will reveal the matter better if you tell me one thing more. Indeed, though I tremble, I will hear and answer all that you ask. Did he go with a small force, or like a chieftain, with many armed followers? Five they were in all—a herald among them—and there was one carriage which bore Laius. Alas! It is all clear now! Who gave you this information, lady? A servant, the only survivor who returned home. Is he by any chance in the house now? No. Soon after he returned and found you ruling in Laius’ stead, he pled with me, with hand laid on mine, to send him to the fields, to the pastures of the flocks, that he might be far from the sight of this town.  And I sent him; he was worthy, for a slave, to win even a larger favor than that. Would, then, that he return to us without delay! That is easy.  But why do you enjoin this? I fear, lady, that my words have been rash,  and therefore I wish to see him. He will come.  But I think that I too have a claim to learn what lies heavy on your heart, my king. It will not be kept from you, now that my forebodings have advanced so far.  To whom more than to you would I speak in suffering such a fortune as this?  My father was Polybus of my mother the Dorian Merope.  I was considered the greatest of the folk in that town, until a chance event befell me, worthy, indeed, of wonder, though not of my overreaction regarding it.  At a banquet, a man drunk with wine cast it at me that I was not the true son of my father.  And I, vexed, restrained myself for that day as best as I could, but on the next went to my mother and father and questioned them.  They were angry at the one who had let this taunt fly. So I had comfort about them, but the matter rankled in my heart, for such a rumor still\\n                     spread widely. I went to but in his response set forth other things, full of sorrow and terror and woe: that I was\\n                     fated to defile my mother’s bed, that I would reveal to men a brood which they\\n                     could not endure to behold, and that I would slay the father that sired me.\\n                     When I heard this, I turned in flight from the land of from then on thinking of it only by its position under the stars, to some spot where I should never see fulfillment of the infamies foretold in my evil fate.  And on my way I came to the land in which you say that this prince perished. To us, king, these things are fraught with fear.  Yet have hope, until at least you have gained full knowledge from the one who saw the deed. I have, in truth, this much hope alone: I await the man summoned from the pastures. And what do you want from him when he appears? I will tell you.  If his story is found to match withwith yours, I at least, will stand clear of disaster. And what special note did you hear from me? You said that he spoke of Laius as slain by robbers.  If, then, he still speaks of several as before, I was not the slayer: a solitary man could not be considered the same as that band.  But if he names one lonely wayfarer, then beyond doubt this guilt rests upon me. Be assured that thus, at least, the tale was first told.  He cannot revoke that, for the city heard it, not I alone.  But even if he should diverge somewhat from his former story, never, king, can he show that the murder of Laius, at least, is truly square with the prophecy, for Loxias plainly said that he was to die at the hand of my child. How was it then that that poor innocent never slew him, but perished first?  From now on then, as far as divination goes, I would not look to my right hand or my left. You are right.  But nevertheless send someone to fetch the peasant, and do not neglect this matter. I will send for him without delay.  But let us go into the house: I will do nothing which does not please you. May destiny still find me winning the praise of reverent purity in all words and deeds sanctioned by those laws of sublime  range, called into life through the high clear aether, whose father is no, nor shall oblivion ever lay them to sleep: the god is mighty in them, and he does not grow old. Insolence breeds the tyrant.  Insolence, once vainly stuffed with wealth that is not proper or good for it, when it has scaled the topmost ramparts, is hurled to\\n                        a dire doom, where one’s feet cannot serve to good advantage. But I pray\\n                        that the god never quell such rivalry as benefits the state.  I will always hold the god as our protector. But if any man walks haughtily in deed or word, with no fear of Justice, no reverence for the images of gods, may an evil doom seize him for his ill-starred pride, if he does not gain his advantage fairly, or avoid unholy deeds, but seeks to lay profaning hands on sanctities.  Where such things occur, what mortal shall boast any more that he can ward off the arrow of the gods from his life? No.  For if such deeds are held in honor, why should we join in the sacred dance? No longer will I go reverently to the earth’s central and inviolate\\n                        shrine, no more to Abae’s temple or to if these oracles do not fit the outcome, so that all mortals shall point at them with their fingers. No, King—if this you are rightly called—Zeus all ruling, may it not escape you and your deathless power!  The old prophecies concerning Laius are fading; already men give them no value, and nowhere is Apollo glorified with honors; the worship of the gods is perishing. Princes of the land, I am planning to visit the shrines of the gods, with this wreathed branch and these gifts of incense in my hands.  For Oedipus excites his soul excessively with all sorts of grief, as he does not judge the new things from the old, like a man of sense, but is under the control of the speaker, if he speaks of frightful things.  Since, then, I can do no good by counsel, to you, Lycean Apollo—for you are nearest— I have come as a suppliant with these symbols of prayer, that you may find us some escape from uncleanliness.  For now we are all afraid, like those who see fear in the helmsman of their ship. Can you tell me, strangers, where the house of King Oedipus is?  Or better still, tell me where he himself is, if you know. This is his dwelling, and he himself, stranger, is within.  This lady here is the mother of his children. Then may she be ever happy in a happy home, since she is his blessed queen. Happiness to you also, stranger!  Your fair greeting deserves this.  But say what you have come to seek or to tell. Good tidings, lady, for your house and your husband. What are they?  From whom have you come? From What is it?  Why has it this double potency? The people will make him king of the Isthmian land, as it was said there. How then?  Is the aged Polybus no longer in power? No. For death holds him in the tomb. What do you mean?  Is Polybus dead, old man? If I do not speak the truth, I am content to die. Handmaid, away with all speed, and tell this to your master!  Oracles of the gods, where do you stand now? It is this man that Oedipus long feared he would slay.  And now this man has died in the course of destiny, not by his hand. Iocasta, dearest wife, why have you summoned me forth from these doors? Hear this man, and judge, as you listen, what the awful oracles have come to. Who is he and what news does he have for me? He comes from How, stranger?  Let me have it from your own mouth. If I must first make these tidings plain, know indeed that he is dead and gone. By treachery, or from illness? A light tilt of the scale brings the aged to their rest. Ah, he died, it seems, of sickness? Yes, and of the long years that he had lived. Alas, alas! Why indeed, my wife, should one look to the hearth of the Pythian seer, or to the birds that scream above our heads, who declared that I was doomed to slay my father?  But he is dead, and lies beneath the earth, and here I am, not having put my hand to any spear—unless, perhaps, he died out of longing for me: thus, indeed, I would be the cause of his death. But as the oracles stand, at least, Polybus has swept them with him to his rest in Hades.  They are worth nothing. Did I not long ago foretell this to you? You did, but I was mislead by my fear. Now no longer take any of those things to heart. But surely I must fear my mother’s bed. What should a mortal man fear, for whom the decrees of Fortune are supreme, and who has clear foresight of nothing?  It is best to live at random, as one may. But fear not that you will wed your mother.  Many men before now have slept with their mothers in dreams.  But he to whom these things are as though nothing bears his life most easily. All these words of yours would have been well said, were my mother not alive.  But as it is, since she lives, I must necessarily fear, though you do speak well. Your father’s death is a great sign for us to take cheer. Great, I know.  But my fear is of her who lives. And who is the woman about whom you fear? Merope, old man, the consort of Polybus. And what is it in her that moves your fear? A divine oracle of dread import, stranger. Proper, or improper, for another to know? Proper, surely.  Loxias once said that I was doomed to marry my own mother, and to shed with my own hands my father’s blood. For which\\n                     reasons I long shirked my home in Corinth—with a happy outcome, to be sure, but\\n                     still it is sweet to see the face of one’s parents. Was it really for fear of this that you became an exile from that city? And because I did not wish, old man, to be the murderer of my father. Why have I not relieved you of this second fear,  my lord, since I came to give you pleasure? And indeed you will have worthy thanks from me. And indeed I came specially for this, that I might profit from your returning home. But by no means will I ever go near my parents again. My son, it is crystal clear that you do not know what you are doing. How so, old man?  In the name of the gods, tell me. If on account of this you are fleeing from returning home. Fearing indeed lest Apollo’s prophecy come true in me. Lest you acquire some pollution from your parents? This very thing, old man, this constantly frightens me. Do you know, then, that your fears are wholly in vain?  Because you had no blood in common with Polybus. What are you saying?  Was Polybus not my father? Just as much, and no more, than he who speaks to you. And how can my father be equal to him who is as though nothing to me? But he did not father you, any more than I did. How, then, did he call me his son? Long ago he received you as a gift from my hands. And yet he loved me so dearly, who came from another’s hand? His former childlessness won him over. And had you bought me or found me by chance, when you gave me to him? I found you in Cithaeron’s winding glens. And why were you roaming those regions? I was in charge of mountain flocks. What, you were a shepherd—a vagrant hireling? But your savior, my son, in that hour. And what was my pain when you took me in your arms? The ankles of your feet might bear witness. Ah me, why do you speak of that old trouble? I freed you when you had your ankles pinned together. It was a dread brand of shame that I took from my cradle. So much so that from that fortune you were called by that name which you still bear. Oh, in the name of the gods, was the deed my mother’s or father’s?\\n                     Speak! I know not.  He who gave you to me knows better of that than I. What, you got me from another?  You did not find me yourself? No.  Another shepherd gave you to me. Who was he?  Can you tell clearly? I think he was said to be one of the household of Laius. The king who ruled this country long ago? The same.  The man was a herdsman in his service. Is he still alive, that I might see him? You natives of this country should know best. Is there any of you here present that knows the herdsman of whom he speaks, having seen him either in the pastures or here in town?  Answer! The hour has come for these things to be revealed finally. I think he speaks of no other than the peasant you already wanted to see.  But our lady Iocasta might best tell you that. Lady, do you know the one whom we summoned just now? Is it of him that this man speaks? Why ask of whom he spoke?  Regard it not; waste not a thought on what he said; it would be vain. It must not happen that, with such clues in my grasp, I fail to bring my birth to light. For the gods’ sake, if you have any care for your own life, do not continue this search!\\n                     My anguish is enough. Be of good courage.  Even if I should be found the son of a servile mother—a slave by three descents—you will not be proven baseborn. Hear me, I implore you: do not do this. I will not hear of not discovering the whole truth. Yet I wish you well—I counsel you for the best. These best counsels, then, vex my patience. Oh ill-fated man, may you never know who you are! Go, some one, fetch me the herdsman. Leave this woman to glory in her princely stock. Alas, alas, miserable man—that word alone can I say to you—and no other word ever again. Why has this woman gone, Oedipus, rushing off in wild grief?  I fear a storm of sorrow will soon break forth from this silence. Break forth what will!  Be my race ever so lowly, I crave to learn it.  That woman perhaps—for she is proud with more than a woman’s pride—feels ashamed of my lowly origin.  But I, who hold myself son of Fortune that gives good, will not be dishonored.  She is the mother from whom I spring, and the months, my kinsmen, have marked me sometimes lowly, sometimes great.  Such being my heritage, never more can I prove false to it, or keep from searching out the secret of my birth. If I am a seer or wise of heart, Cithaeron, you will not fail—by heaven, you will not—to know at tomorrow’s full moon that Oedipus honors you as native to him, as his nurse, and his mother, and that you are celebrated in our dance and song, because you are well-pleasing to our prince.  O Phoebus to whom we cry, may these things find favor in your sight! Who was it, my son, who of the race whose years are many, that bore you in wedlock with Pan, the mountain-roaming father?  Or was it a bride of Loxias that bore you?  For dear to him are all the upland pastures. Or perhaps it was Cyllene’s lord, or the Bacchants’ god, dweller on the hill-tops, that received you, a new-born joy, from one of the nymphs of Helicon, with whom he most often sports. Elders, if it is right for me, who have never met the man, to guess, I think I see the herdsman we have been looking for for a lone time.  In his venerable old age he tallies with this stranger’s years, and moreover I recognize those who bring him, I think, as servants of mine. But perhaps you have an advantage in knowledge over me, if you have seen the herdsman before. Yes, I know him, be sure.  He was in the service of Laius—trusty as any  shepherd. I ask you first, Corinthian stranger, if this is the man you mean. He is, the one you are looking at. You, old man—look this way and answer all that I ask—were you once in the service of Laius? I was—not a bought slave, but reared in his house. Employed in what labor, or what way of life? For the better part of my life I tended the flocks. And what regions did you most frequently haunt? Sometimes Cithaeron, sometimes the neighboring ground. Are you aware of ever having seen this man in these parts? Doing what? What man do you mean? This man here.  Have you ever met him before? Not so that I could speak at once from memory. And no wonder, master.  But I will bring clear recollection to his ignorance. I am sure he knows well of the time we dwelled in the region of Cithaeron for six month periods, from spring to Arcturus, he with two flocks, and I, his comrade, with one.  And then for the winter I used to drive my flock to my own fold, and he took his to the fold of Laius. Did any of this happen as I tell it, or did it not? You speak the truth, though it was long ago. Come, tell me now: do you remember having given me a boy in those days, to be reared as my own foster-son? What now?  Why do you ask the question? This man, my friend, is he who then was young. Damn you!  Be silent once and for all! Do not rebuke him, old man.  Your words need rebuking more than his. And in what way, most noble master, do I offend? In not telling of the boy about whom he asks. He speaks without knowledge, but is busy to no purpose. You will not speak with good grace, but will in pain. No, in the name of the gods, do not mistreat an old man. Someone, quick—tie his hands him this instant! Alas, why?  What do you want to learn? Did you give this man the child about whom he asks? I did.  Would that I had perished that day! Well, you will come to that, unless you tell the honest truth. But if I speak I will be destroyed all the more. This man is bent, I think, on more delays. No, no!  I said before that I gave it to him. Where did you get it from?  From your own house, or from another? It was not my own: I received it from another. From whom of the citizens here?  From what home? For the love of the gods, master, ask no more! You are dead if I have to question you again. It was a child, then, of the house of Laius. A slave? Or one of his own clan? Alas!  I am on the brink of speaking the dreaded words. And I of hearing: I must hear nevertheless. You must know then, that it was said to be his own child.   But your lady within could say best how these matters lie. How?  Did she give it to you? Yes, my lord. For what purpose? That I should do away with it. Her own child, the wretched woman? Yes, from fear of the evil prophecies. What were they? The tale ran that he would slay his father. Why, then, did you give him to this old man? Out of pity, master, thinking that he would carry him to another land, from where he himself came.  But he saved him for the direst woe. For if you are what this man says, be certain that you were born ill-fated. Oh, oh!  All brought to pass, all true.  Light, may I now look on you for the last time—I who have been found to be accursed in birth, accursed in wedlock, accursed in the shedding of blood. Alas, generations of mortals, how mere a shadow I count your life!  Where, where is the mortal who attains a happiness which is more than apparent and doomed to fall away to nothing?  Your fate warns me—yours, unhappy Oedipus—to call no earthly creature blessed. For he, O Zeus, shot his shaft with peerless skill, and won the prize of an all-prosperous fortune, having slain the maiden with crooked talons, who sang darkly. He arose for our land like a tower against death.  And from that time, Oedipus, you have been called our king, and have been honored supremely, holding power in great But now whose story is more grievous in men’s ears? Who is a more wretched slave to fierce plagues and troubles, with all his life reversed?  Alas, renowned Oedipus!  The same bounteous harbor was sufficient for you, both as child and as father, to make your nuptial couch in. Oh, how can the soil in which your father sowed, unhappy man, have endured you in silence for so long? Time the all-seeing has found you out, against your will: he judges the monstrous marriage in which parent and child have long been one.  Alas, child of Laius, would that I had never seen you.  I wail as one who pours a dirge from his lips. It was you who gave me new life, to speak directly, and through you darkness has fallen upon my eyes. You who are most honored in this land, what deeds you will hear, what deeds you will behold, what burden of sorrow will be yours, if, true to your race, you still care for the house of Labdacus.  For I think that neither the Ister nor the And those griefs smart the most which are seen to be of our own choice. Indeed the troubles which we knew before are far from being easy to bear.  Besides them, what do you have to announce? This is the shortest tale to tell and hear: our royal lady Iocasta is dead. Alas, wretched lady!  From what cause? By her own hand.  You will not suffer the worst part of the painful event, since you do not behold the events.  Nevertheless, so far as my memory serves, you will learn that unhappy woman’s fate. she dashed the doors together behind her, then called on the name of Laius, long since a corpse, thinking of that son, born long ago, by whose hand the father was slain, leaving the mother to breed accursed offspring with his own child.  And she bewailed the marriage in which, wretched woman, she had given birth to a twofold brood, husband by husband, children by her child.  And how she perished is more than I know.  For with a shriek Oedipus burst in, and did not allow us to watch her woe until the end:  on him, as he rushed around, our eyes were set. To and fro he went, asking us to give him a sword, asking where he could find the wife who was no wife, but a mother whose womb had borne both him and his children.  And in his frenzy a power greater than mortal man was his guide, for it was none of us mortals who were near. With a dread cry, as though someone beckoned him on, he sprang at the double doors, forced the bending bolts from the sockets, and rushed into the room.  There we beheld the woman hanging by the neck in a twisted noose of swinging cords. And when he saw her, with a dread deep cry he released the halter by which she hung.  And when the hapless woman was stretched out on the ground, then the sequel was horrible to see:  for he tore from her raiment the golden brooches with which she had decorated herself, and lifting them struck his own eye-balls, uttering words like these:  No longer will you behold such horrors as I was suffering and performing! Long enough have you looked on those whom you ought never to have seen, having failed in the knowledge of those whom I yearned to know—henceforth you shall be dark! With such a dire refrain, he struck his eyes with raised hand not once but often.  At each blow the bloody eye-balls bedewed his beard, and sent forth not sluggish drops of gore, but all at once a dark shower of blood came down like hail. From the deeds of the two of them such ills have broken forth, not on one alone, but with mingled woe for man and wife.  The old happiness of their ancestral fortune was once happiness indeed.  But now today lamentation, ruin, death, shame, and every earthly ill that anyone could name are all theirs. And does the sufferer have any respite from pain now? He cries for some one to unbar the gates and show to all the Cadmeans his father’s slayer, his mother’s—the words must not pass my lips— in order to banish himself from the land and not to put the house under his own curse by waiting here.  And yet he lacks strength, and one to guide his steps, for the anguish is more than he can bear.  He will soon show this to you: look, the bars of the gates are withdrawn, and soon you will behold a sight which even he who abhors it must pity. O dread fate for men to see, O most dreadful of all that I have set my eyes on!  Unhappy one, what madness has come upon you? Who is the unearthly foe who, with a leap of more than mortal range has made your ill-starred life his prey?  Alas, alas, you hapless man!  I cannot even look on you, though there is much I desire to ask, much I desire to learn, much that draws my wistful gaze:  with such a shuddering do you fill me! Woe is me!  Alas, alas, wretched that I am!  Where, where am I carried in my misery? How is my voice swept abroad on the wings of the air?  Oh, my fate, how far you have sprung! To a dread place, dire in men’s ears, dire in their sight. Oh horror of darkness that enfolds me, unspeakable visitant, resistless, sped by a wind too favorable!  Oh, me! and once again, Oh, me! How my soul is pierced by the stab of these goads and by the memory of sorrows! No wonder that amidst these woes you mourn and bear a double pain. Ah, friend, you still are steadfast in your care for me, and still have patience to tend to the blind man! Ah, me! Your presence is not hidden from me—no, blind though I am, nevertheless I know your voice full well. Man of dread deeds, how could you quench your vision in this way?  What divinity urged you on? It was Apollo, friends, Apollo who brought these troubles to pass, these terrible, terrible troubles.  But the hand that struck my eyes was none other than my own, wretched that I am! Why should I see, when sight showed me nothing sweet? These things were just as you say. What, my friends, can I behold anymore, what can I love, what greeting can touch my ear with joy?  Hurry, friends, lead me from the land, lead me from here, the utterly lost, the thrice-accursed, the mortal most hateful to the gods! Wretched alike for your fortune and for your understanding of it, would that I had never known you! Perish the man, whoever he was, who freed me in the past years from the cruel shackle on my feet—a thankless deed!  Had I died then, I would not have been so sore a grief to my friends and to my own soul. I too would have had it thus. In this way I would not have come to shed my father’s blood, or been known among men as the husband of the woman from whom I was born. Now I am forsaken by the gods, son of a defiled mother, successor to the bed of the man who gave me my own wretched being: if there is a woe surpassing all woes, it has become Oedipus’ lot. I cannot agree that you have counseled well: you would have been better dead than living and blind. Do not tell me that things have not been best done in this way: give me counsel no more.  If I had sight, I know not with what eyes I could even have looked on my father, when I came to the house of Hades, or on my miserable mother, since against both I have sinned such sins as hanging myself could not punish. But do you think that the sight of children, born as mine were, was lovely for me to look upon? No, no, never lovely to my eyes!  No, neither was this town with its towering walls, nor the sacred statues of the gods, since I, thrice wretched that I am— I, noblest of the sons of Thebes—have doomed myself to know them no more by commanding that all should reject the impious one, the one whom the gods have revealed as unholy, a member of Laius’ own race!  After bearing such a stain upon myself, was I to look with steady eyes on this folk?  No indeed: were there a way to choke the source of hearing, I would not have hesitated to make a fast prison of this wretched frame, so that I should have known neither sight nor sound. It is sweet for our thought to dwell beyond the sphere of grief.  Alas, Cithaeron, why did you provide a shelter for me?  When I was given to you, why did you not slay me straightway, that I might never reveal my origin to men.  Ah, Polybus, ah, how fair-seeming was I, your nurseling, and what evils were festering underneath!  Now I am found to be evil and of evil birth.  Oh you three roads, and you secret glen, you, thicket, and narrow way where three paths met— you who drank my father’s blood from my own hands—do you remember, perhaps, what deeds I\\n                     have performed in your sight, and then what fresh deeds I went on to do when I\\n                     came here? Oh marriage rites, you gave me birth, and when you had brought me\\n                     forth, you again bore children to your child, you created an incestuous kinship of fathers, brothers, sons, brides, wives, and mothers—all the foulest deeds that are wrought among men!  But it is improper to mention what it is improper to do— hurry, for the love of the gods, hide me somewhere beyond the land, or slay me, or cast me into the sea, where you will never behold me any longer!  Approach—deign to lay your hands on a wretched man—listen and fear not:  my plague can rest on no other mortal. But here is Creon in good time to plan and perform that which you request.  He alone is left to guard the land in your place. Ah, me, how will I address him? What claim to credence can be shown on my part?  For in the past I proved to be wholly false to him. I have not come to mock or reproach you with any any past fault. For the gods’ love—since you have done a gentle violence to my prediction\\n                     and come in a spirit so noble to me, a man most vile—grant me a favor: I will\\n                     speak for your own good, not mine. And what do you wish so eagerly to get from me? Cast me out of this land with all speed, to a place where no mortal shall be found to greet me. This I could have done, to be sure, except I craved first to learn from the god all my duty. But his pronouncement has been set forth in full—to let me perish, the parricide, unholy one that I am. Thus it was said.  But since we have come to such a pass, it is better to learn clearly what should be done. Will you, then, seek a response on behalf of such a wretch as I? Yes, for even you yourself will now surely put faith in the god. Yes.  And on you I lay this charge, to you I make this entreaty:  give to the woman within such burial as you wish—you will properly render the last rites to your own.  But never let this city of my father be condemned to have me dwelling within, as long as I live.  No, allow me to live in the hills, where Cithaeron, famed as mine, sits, which my mother and father, while they lived, fixed as my appointed tomb, so that I may die according to the decree of those who sought to slay me. And yet I know this much, that neither sickness nor anything else can destroy me; for I would never have been snatched from death, except in order to suffer some strange doom. they are men, so that they will never lack the means to live wherever they should be.  My two girls, poor hapless ones—who never knew my table spread separately, or lacked their father’s presence, but always had a share of all that reached my hands—I implore you to take care of them.  And, if you can, allow me to touch them with my hands, and to indulge my grief.  Grant it, prince, grant it, noble heart.  Ah, if I could but once touch them with my hands, I would think that I had them just as when I had sight. What is this?  Oh, gods, can it be my loved ones that I hear sobbing, can Creon have taken pity on me and sent my children, my darlings? Am I right? You are.  I have brought this about, for I knew the joy which you have long had from them—the joy you now have. Bless you, and for this errand may the god prove a kinder guardian to you than he has to me. My children, where are you?  Come, here, here to the hands of the one whose mother was your own, the hands that have made your father’s once bright eyes to be such orbs as these—his, who seeing nothing, knowing nothing, became your father by her from whom he was born!  For you also do I weep, though I cannot see you, when I think of the bitter life that men will make you live in days to come.   To what company of the citizens will you go, to what festival, from which you will not return home in tears, not sharing in the holiday?  But when you reach a ripe age for marriage, who shall he be, who shall be the man, my daughters, to risk taking upon himself the reproaches that will certainly be baneful to my offspring and yours?  What misery is lacking?  Your father killed his own father, and bore you from the source of his own being! Such are the taunts that will be cast at you.  And who then will wed you?  The man does not live, no, it cannot be, my children, but you will wither in barren maidenhood.  Son of Menoeceus, hear me: since you are the only father left to them—we, their parents, are both gone— do not allow them to wander poor and unwed, for they are your own kin, nor abase them to the level of my woes.  Pity them, seeing them deprived of everything but you at such an age. Promise, noble man, and touch them with your hand.  To you, children, I would have given much counsel, if your minds were mature.  But now pray that you may live where occasion allows, and that the life which is your lot may be happier than your father’s. Your grief has had a sufficient scope: move on into the house. I must obey, though I do it in no way gladly. Yes, for it is in season that all things are good. Do you know on what terms I will go? You will tell me, and then I will know when I have heard them. See that you send me to dwell outside this land. You ask for what the god must give. But to the gods I have become most hateful. Then you will quickly get your wish. So you consent? It is not my way to say idly what I do not mean. Then it is time to lead me away. Come, then, but let your children go. No, do not take them from me! Do not wish to be master in all things:  the mastery which you did attain has not followed you through life. Residents of our native who knew the renowned riddle, and was a most mighty man.  What citizen did not gaze on his fortune with envy?  See into what a stormy sea of troubles he has come! Therefore, while our eyes wait to see the final destined day, we must call no mortal happy until he has crossed life’s border free from pain.  \n",

                             Child of a blind old man, Antigone, to what region have we come, or to what city of men? Who will entertain the wandering Oedipus today with scanty gifts? Little do I crave, and obtain still less than that little, and with that I am content. For patience is the lesson of suffering, and of the long years upon me, and lastly of a noble mind. My child, if you see any resting-place, either on profane ground or by groves of the gods, stop me and set me down, so that we may inquire where we are. We have come to learn as foreigners from the townsmen, and to bring to completion whatever we hear. Father, toil-worn Oedipus, the towers that ring the city, to judge by sight, are far off; and this place is sacred, to judge from its appearance: laurel, olive, and vine grow thick-set; and a feathered crowd of nightingales makes music within. So sit here on this unshaped stone; you have travelled a long way for an old man. Seat me, then, and watch over the blind. If time can teach, I need not learn that. Can you tell me, now, where we have arrived?  Yes, so much every traveller told us. Well, shall I go and learn what the spot is called? Yes, child, if indeed it is inhabited. It surely is inhabited. But I think there is no need—I see a man nearby. Setting off and coming toward us? He is at our side already. Speak whatever seems timely to you, for the man is here. Stranger, hearing from this maiden, who has sight both for herself and for me, that you have arrived as a scout of good fortune for the solving of our doubts— Now, before you question me at length, leave this seat. You occupy ground which is unholy to tread upon. And what is this ground? To which of the gods is it sacred? Ground inviolable, on which no one may dwell. The dread goddesses hold it, the daughters of Earth and Darkness. Who are they? Whose awful name might I hear and invoke in prayer? The all-seeing Eumenides the people here would call them: but other names please elsewhere. Then graciously may they receive their suppliant! Nevermore will I depart from my seat in this land. What does this mean? The watchword of my fate. I dare not remove you without warrant from the city, until I report what I am doing. Now by the gods, stranger, do not deny me, hapless wanderer as you see, the honor of the knowledge for which I beg you. Tell me, and you will not be without honor from me. What, then, is the place that we have entered? All that I myself know, you will hear and learn. This whole place is sacred; august Poseidon holds it, and in it lives the fire-bearing god, the Titan Prometheus. But as for the spot on which you tread, it is called the bronze threshold of this land, the support of and all the people bear his name in common as their own. Such, you see, stranger, are these haunts. They receive their honor not through story, but rather through our living with them. Are there indeed dwellers in this region? Yes indeed, the namesakes of that god there Have they a king? Or does speaking These parts are ruled by the king in the city. And who is he that is sovereign in counsel and in might? Theseus he is called, son of Aegeus who was before him. Could a messenger go to him from among you? With what aim? To speak, or to prepare his coming? So that by a small service he may find a great gain. And what help can come from one who cannot see? In all that I speak there will be vision. Take care now, stranger, that you come to no harm; for you are noble, if I may judge by your looks, leaving your ill-fortune aside. Stay here, where I found you, until I go and tell these things to the people of this district—not in the city. They will decide for you whether you should stay or go back. My child, has the stranger left us? He is gone, and so you can speak what you wish, father, fully at ease, knowing that I alone am near. Ladies of dread aspect, since your seat is the first in this land at which I have bent my knee, show yourselves not ungracious to Phoebus or to myself; who, when he proclaimed that doom of many woes, spoke to me of this rest after long years: on reaching my goal in a land where I should find a seat of the Awful Goddesses and a shelter for foreigners, there I should close my weary life, with profit, through my having fixed my abode there, for those who received me, but ruin for those who sent me forth, who drove me away. And he went on to warn me that signs of these things would come, in earthquake, or in thunder, or in the lightning of Zeus. —or taken this august seat not shaped by men. enslaved as I am evermore to woes the sorest on the earth. Hear, sweet daughters of primeval Darkness! Hear, you that are called the city of great Pallas, For in truth it is the former living body no more. Hush! Here come some aged men to spy out your resting-place. I will be mute. But hide me in the grove, apart from the road, till I learn how these men will speak.  For in learning is the safeguard of our course. Look! Who was he, then? Where is he staying? Where has he rushed from this place, man most insatiate of all who live? Scan the ground, look well, press the search everywhere. A wanderer that old man must have been, a wanderer, not a dweller in the land; otherwise he never would have advanced into this untrodden grove of the maidens with whom none may strive. Their name we tremble to speak; we pass them by with eyes turned away, moving our lips, without sound or word, in still devotion. and him I cannot yet discern, though I look round all the holy place, nor do I know where to find his lodging. Behold the man you seek! In sound is my sight, as the saying goes. Oh! Oh! Fearful he is to see, and fearful to hear! Do not regard me, I beg you, as a lawless man. Zeus defend us! Who may this old man be? Not so wholly of the best fate that you would call him fortunate, guardians of this land! It is plain; otherwise I would not be creeping, as you see, by the eyes of others, and buoying my strength upon weakness. Alas! Were you sightless even from birth? Evil have been your days, and many, it appears. But at least if I can help it, you shall not add this curse to your lot. You go too far—too far! That your rash steps may intrude on the field of this voiceless,  grassy glade, where the waters of the mixing bowl blend their stream with the flow of honied offerings, beware, unhappiest of strangers. Retire! Withdraw! Let a wide space part us. Do you hear, toil-worn wanderer? If you have anything to say in converse with us, leave forbidden ground, and speak where it is lawful for all; but, till then, refrain. Daughter, to what counsel shall we incline? My father, we must behave just as the townspeople do, listening and giving way where it is necessary. Then give me your hand. I lay it in yours. Strangers, let me not suffer wrong when I have trusted in you, and have passed from my refuge! Never, old man, never will anyone remove you from your resting-place here against your will. Further, then? Come still further. Further? Lead him onward, maiden, for you hear us and obey. Come, follow this way with your dark steps, father, as I lead you. Stranger in a foreign land, poor man, have the courage to detest what the city steadfastly holds as not dear, and to reverence what it holds dear! Lead me, then, child, to a spot where I may speak and listen within piety’s domain, and let us not wage war with necessity. There! Do not incline your steps beyond that ledge of bedrock. This far? Enough, I say Shall I sit down? Yes, move sideways, and crouch low on the edge of the rock. Father, this is my task: calmly to— Ah me! ah me! —fit step to step, and lean your aged frame upon my dear arm. Alas for my sad destruction! Ah, poor man, since now you are at ease, speak! What is your lineage among mortals? With what name are you led on your weary path? What fatherland can you tell us of? Strangers, I am without a city, but do not— What is this that you forbid, old man? do not, do not ask me who I am! Do not seek or probe further! What does this mean? Horrid the birth— Speak! My child—ah, me!—what shall I say? What is your lineage, stranger? Speak! And who is your father? Woe is me! What will become of me, my child? Speak, for you are driven to the verge. Then speak I will. I have no way to hide it. You two make a long delay. Come, hasten! Do you know of a son of Laius? Oh! —And the race of the Labdacidae? O Zeus! —and the pitiful Oedipus? You are he? Have no fear of any words that I speak— Ah, no, no! Unhappy that I am! Oh, oh! Daughter, what is about to happen? Out with you! Go forth from the land! And your promise—to what fulfillment will you bring it? No man is visited by the punishment of fate if he requites deeds which were first done to himself. Deceit on the one part matches deceits on the other, and gives pain instead of pleasure for reward. And you—back with you! Out from your seat! Away from my land with all speed, that you may not fasten some heavier burden on my city! Reverent strangers, since you have not endured my aged father—knowing, as you do, the rumor of his unintended deeds—pity at least my poor self, I implore you, who supplicate you for my father alone. I beg you with eyes that can still look on your own, like one sprung from your own blood, that this sufferer may meet with reverent treatment. I implore you by everything that you hold dear at home: by child, by wife, or treasure, or god! Look well and you will not find the mortal who, if a god should lead him on, could escape. Feel sure, daughter of Oedipus, that we pity you and him alike for your misfortune; but dreading the punishment of the gods, we could not say anything beyond what we have now said to you. What help comes, then, of repute or fair fame, if it ends in idle breath; seeing that Not, surely, afraid of my person or of my acts; since my acts, at least, have been in suffering rather than doing—if I must mention the tale of my mother and my father, because of which you fear me. That know I full well. And yet how was I innately evil? I, who was merely requiting a wrong, so that, had I been acting with knowledge, even then I could not be accounted evil. But, as it was, all unknowing I went where I went—while they who wronged me knowingly sought my ruin. Therefore, strangers, I beseech you by the gods: just as you made me leave my seat, so protect me, and do not, while you render honor to the gods, consider those gods to be fools. But rather consider that they look on the god-fearing man and on the godless, and that never yet has an impious man found escape. rescue me and guard me to the end; nor dishonor me when you look on this face unlovely to behold, for I have come to you as one sacred and pious, bearing comfort for this people. But when the master has come, whoever is your leader, then you will hear and know all; meanwhile show yourselves in no way evil. The thoughts you urge, old man, must move awe; they have been set forth in grave words. But I am content that the rulers of our country should judge in this case. And where, strangers, is the lord of this realm? He is at the city of his fathers in our land. The messenger who sent us here has gone to fetch him. Do you think that he will have any regard or care for the blind man, so as to come here himself? Yes, surely, as soon as he learns of your name. Who is there to bring him that word? The way is long, and many words from travellers often wander about. When he hears them, he will soon be with us, never fear. For your name, old man, has been loudly trumpeted through all lands, so that even if he is taking his ease, and slow to move, when he hears of you he will swiftly arrive. Well, may he come with good fortune both for his own city and for me! What noble man is not his own friend? O Zeus! What shall I say? What shall I think, my father? What is it, Antigone, my child? I see a woman coming towards us, mounted on a colt of What shall I say? Is it she, or is it not?  Does my judgment err? Yes—no—I cannot tell—ah, me! It is no other, yes! She greets me with bright glances as she draws near, and makes a signal. Here is Ismene, clearly, and no other before me. What is that you say, my child? That I see your daughter, my sister. By her voice right away you can know her. Father and sister, names most sweet to me! How hard it was to find you! And how hard now to look upon you for my tears! My child, have you come? Father, your fate is sad to see! Are you with us, my child? Not without toil, indeed, for myself. Touch me, my daughter! I give a hand to each at once. Ah my children, my sisters! Alas, twice-wretched life! Her life and mine? And mine, wretched me, makes a third. Child, why have you come? Through concern for you, father. Through longing to see me? Yes, and to bring you news by my own mouth, with the only faithful servant that I had. And where are the young men, your brothers, in our need? They are where they are; their circumstances now are terrible. True image of the ways of but the wives go forth to win the daily bread.  And in your case, my daughters, those to whom these toils belonged keep the house at home like maidens, while you two, in their place, bear your poor father’s woes. The one, from the time when her youth was past and she came into her strength, has always been this old man’s guide in weary wanderings, often roaming, hungry and barefoot, through the wild woods, often battered by rains and scorching sun. And the comforts of home, poor girl, she holds in the second place, so long as her father should have her care. You became a faithful guardian on my behalf, when I was being driven from the land. Now, in turn, what new tidings have you brought your father, Ismene? On what mission have you set forth from home? For you do not come empty-handed, I know well, or without some cause of fear for me. The sufferings that I bore, father, in seeking where you dwelt, I will pass by; I would not renew the pain in the recital. But the evils that now beset your ill-fated sons—it is of these that I have come to tell. At first it was their decision that the throne should be left to Creon, and the city spared pollution, when they thought calmly about the ancient blight on our race, and how it has clung to your unfortunate house. But now, moved by some god and by sinful heart, an evil strife has seized them—thrice-deluded!—to grasp at rule and the power of a tyrant. And the younger son has stripped the elder, Polyneices, of the throne, and has driven him from his fatherland. But he, as the widespread rumor says among us, has gone to the valley of or send its praises to the sky. These are not empty words, my father, but terrible deeds; and where the gods will have pity on your grief, I cannot tell. What, had you come to hope that the gods would ever have concern enough for me to give me rescue? Yes, that is my hope, father, from the present oracles. What are they? What has been prophesied, my child? That you will be desired some day, in life and death, by the men of that land, for their safety’s sake. And who could profit from such a one as I? Their power, it is said, proves to be in your hands. When I no longer exist, then I am a man? Yes, for the gods now raise you up; but before they worked your ruin. It is a paltry thing to raise up age, when youth was ruined. Well, know at least that Creon will come to you on this account—and soon, not late. With what purpose, daughter? Interpret that to me. To plant you near the Cadmean land, so that they may have you in their power, while you may not set foot within their borders. And how can I profit them while I rest beyond their gates? Your tomb contains a curse for them, if it should suffer misfortune. I need no god to help my wits so far. For this reason, therefore, they wish to get you as their neighbor; but in a place where they will have you at their mercy. Will they really cover me in Theban dust? No, the guilt of related blood forbids you, father. Then never will they become my masters. Someday then this will be a grief for the Cadmeans. In what conjunction of events, my child? Under the power of your anger, when they stand at your tomb. And who has told you this, my child? Sacred envoys, from the Delphian hearth. And has Phoebus indeed spoken this concerning me? So say the men who have come back to Has either of my sons heard this? Yes, both have heard it, and know it well. And then those most evil of sons, aware of this, preferred the kingship to the wish of recalling me? It grieves me to hear this, but I must bear it. Then may the gods not quench their fated strife, and may it fall to me to decide this war on which they are now setting their hands, raising spear against spear! For then neither would he who now holds the scepter and the throne survive, nor would the exile ever return; seeing that when I, their father, was being thrust without honor from my country, they did not stop or defend me. No, they saw me sent forth homeless, and heard the crier proclaim my sentence of exile. and my sweetest wish was for death—indeed, death by stoning—no one was found to help me in that desire. But after a time, when all my anguish was now softened, and when I began to feel that my heart had been excessive in punishing those past errors, then it was that the city set about to drive me by force from the land, after all that time. And my sons, when they had the strength to bring help—sons to their own father—they would not do it. For lack of one little word from them, I was left to wander, an outcast and a beggar forever. Instead, it is from these, maidens as they are, insofar as nature enables them, that I obtain my daily food, and a shelter in the land, and the aid of family. Their brothers have bartered their father for the throne, the scepter of power, and the rule of the realm. No, never will they win Oedipus for an ally, nor will good ever come to them from this reign at Therefore let them send Creon to seek me—or whoever else is mighty in and troubles for my enemies. You are worthy of compassion, Oedipus, both you and these maidens. And since to this plea you append your power to save our land, I wish to advise you for your advantage. Dearest friends, be my patrons, and I will bring everything to completion. Then make atonement to these divinities, to whom you have come first, and on whose ground you have trespassed. With what rites? Instruct me, strangers. First, from an ever-flowing spring bring sacred drink-offerings, borne in ritually pure hands. And when I have gotten this unmixed draught? There are bowls, the work of a skilled craftsman; crown their edges and the handles at either side. With olive branches, or woollen cloths, or in what way? Take the freshly-shorn wool of a ewe-lamb. Good; and then to what last rite shall I proceed? Pour the drink-offerings, with your face to the dawn. Shall I pour them with these vessels of which you speak? Yes, in three streams; but the last vessel— With what shall I fill this, before I set it down? Teach me this also. With water and honey; but add no wine. And when the ground under the dark shade has drunk these? Three times lay on it nine branches of olive with both your hands, and meanwhile make this prayer. I wish to hear this prayer; it is the most important part. We call them Eumenides, so that with well-wishing power they may receive the suppliant as his saviors. Let this be your prayer, or of whoever prays for you. Speak inaudibly, and do not lift up your voice; then depart, without looking behind. If you should do this, I would be bold enough to come to your aid; but otherwise, stranger, I would fear for you. Daughters, do you hear these strangers who dwell nearby? We have listened. Tell us what to do. I cannot make the trip; for I am disabled by lack of strength and lack of sight, twin evils. But let one of you two go and do these things. For I think that one soul suffices to pay this debt for ten thousand, if it comes with good will. Act, then, with speed. But do not abandon me, for my body would not have the strength to move, without help or a guiding hand. Then I will go to perform the rite; but where I am to find the place—this I wish to learn. On the further side of this grove, stranger. And if you have need of anything, there is a guardian of the place. He will direct you. Off to my task. But you, Antigone, watch our father here. In the case of parents, if we toil, we must not keep a memory of it. Terrible it is, stranger, to arouse the old woe that has for so long been laid to rest: and yet I yearn to hear— What now? —Of that grief-filled anguish, cureless, with which you have wrestled. By your hospitality, do not uncover the shame that I have suffered! Seeing that the tale is wide-spread and in no way weakens, I wish, friend, to hear it straight. Ah me! Grant the favor, I beg! Alas, alas! Grant my wish, as I have granted yours to the full. I have suffered the greatest misery, strangers—suffered it through unintended deeds—may the god know it!  No part was of my own choice. But in what way? In an evil marriage, the city bound me, unknowing, to ruin. Is it true, as I hear, that you made your mother the partner of your bed, to its infamy? Ah, me! These words, strangers, are like death to my ears. And those two maidens of mine— What will you say? —Two daughters—two curses— O Zeus! —of mine, sprung from the travail of the womb that bore me too. These, then, are at once your daughters, and— —Sisters, indeed, of their father. Oh! Indeed, woes untold sweep back upon my soul! You have suffered— I have suffered woes grievous to bear. You have performed— I have not performed! How? A gift was given to me—O, wretched that I am, if only I had never won from the city that gift for my services! Cursed man! What of this? Did you commit the murder— What now? What would you learn? —Of your father? Oh! oh! a second stab—wound on wound! You killed— I killed—yet I have a plea— What can you plead? —A plea of justice. What? I will tell you: I killed in ignorance and perished utterly. Pure before the law, without knowledge of my act, I have come to this! Look, there comes our lord, Theseus son of Aegeus, at the sound of your voice, to do that for which he was  summoned. Through hearing from many in the past about the bloody marring of your sight, I  recognized it was you, son of Laius; and now on coming here, through sight I am more fully certain. For your clothing and that heart-rending face alike assure me that it is you. And in all compassion I ask you, ill-fated Oedipus, with what petition to the city and to me have you taken your place here, you and the poor maiden at your side. Declare it. Dire indeed must be the fortune which you tell, for me to stand aloof from it; since I know that I myself also was reared in exile, just as you, and that in foreign lands I wrestled with perils to my life, like no other man. Never, then, would I turn aside from a stranger, such as you are now, or refuse to help in his deliverance. For I know well that I am a man, and that my portion of tomorrow is no greater than yours. Theseus, in a few words your nobleness has come to such a point that I need make only a brief reply. You have said who I am, from what father I am sprung, and from what land I have come; and so nothing else remains for me but to speak my wish, and the tale is told. Then inform me of this very thing, so that I may learn it. I come to offer you my care-worn body as a gift—not one fine to look on, but the gains from it are better than beauty. And what gain do you claim to have brought? Later you may learn it—but not yet. At what time, then, will the benefit become clear? When I am dead, and you have given me burial. You crave life’s last service; but for all between you have no memory, or no care. Indeed, for by that service I gather in all the rest. Well then, this favor you crave from me is brief indeed. Yet take care; the struggle here is no light one. No, indeed. Do you mean in respect to your sons, or to me? They will compel you to convey me there to But if you are willing, then exile is not becoming. No, when I was willing, they refused. Foolish man, anger amidst woes is not suitable. When you have heard my story, admonish; till then, forbear. Speak. I must not pronounce without knowledge. I have suffered, Theseus, terrible woes upon woes. Will you speak of the ancient trouble of your race? No, indeed; all Greeks speak of that. How, then, do you suffer beyond what is mortal? The circumstance is this: from my country I have been driven by my own sons; and I may not return, since I am guilty of a father’s blood. Why would they have you brought back, if you must dwell apart? The word of the god will compel them. What suffering do they fear from the oracles? That they must be struck down in this land. And how should bitterness come between them and me? Dearest son of Aegeus, to the gods alone old age and death never come, but everything else sinks into chaos from time which overpowers all. Earth’s strength decays, and so too the strength of the body; trust dies; distrust is born; and the same spirit is never steadfast among friends, or between city and city. For some now, for others tomorrow, sweet feelings turn to bitter, and then once more to being dear. And if now the sun shines brightly between scatter with the spear today’s pledges of concord. Then one day my slumbering and buried corpse, cold in death, will drink their warm blood, if Zeus is still Zeus, and Phoebus, the son of Zeus, speaks clear. Only keep your own pledge good, and never will you say that in vain you welcomed Oedipus to dwell in this land—if indeed the gods do not deceive me. Lord, from the first this man has shown a will to bring these words, or similar ones, to completion for our land. Who, then, would reject the goodwill of such a one? To whom, first, the hearth of a spear-friend is always available on our side, by reciprocal right; then too he has come as a suppliant to our gods, paying no small recompense to this land and to me. In reverence for these claims, I will never spurn his favor, and I will establish a dwelling for him as a citizen in the land. And if it is the pleasure of the stranger to remain here, I will command you to protect him; or, if it pleases him, to come with me. This choice or that, Oedipus, you may take; your desire will be mine. O Zeus, may you be good to men such as these! What is your wish, then? Will you come to my house? Yes, I would, if it were right. But this is the place— What will you do here? Speak, for I will not hinder you. —Where I will conquer those who cast me out. The promised gift of your presence would be great. It shall be, if you keep your pledge with me. Have courage concerning me; never will I betray you. I will not bind you with an oath as if an evil man. Well, you would win nothing more than by my word. What will you do, then? What is it that you fear? Men will come— But these men here will see to that. Beware that if you leave me— Do not instruct me in my duties. Fear constrains me— My heart feels no fear. You do not know the threats— I know that none will lead you from here against my will. Often threats have blustered in men’s hearts with words loud and vain; but when the mind comes to itself once more, the threats have vanished. For those men, too, perhaps—yes, even if in boldness they have spoken dreadful things of bringing you back, the voyage here will prove long and hard to sail. Now I exhort you, apart from any decision of mine, to take heart, if indeed Phoebus has been your escort here. Even if I am not present, still my name, I know, will shield you from harm. Stranger, in this land of fine horses you have come to earth’s fairest home, the shining Here the nightingale, a constant guest, trills her clear note under the trees of green glades, dwelling amid the wine-dark ivy and the god’s inviolate foliage, rich in berries and fruit, unvisited by sun, unvexed by the wind of any storm.  Here the reveller Dionysus ever walks the ground, companion of the nymphs that nursed him. And, fed on heavenly dew, the narcissus blooms day by day with its fair clusters; it is the ancient crown of the Great Goddesses. And the crocus blooms with a golden gleam. Nor do the ever-flowing springs diminish, from which the waters of Cephisus wander, and each day with pure current it moves over the plains of the land’s swelling bosom, bringing fertility. Nor have the dancing Muses shunned this place, nor Aphrodite of the golden rein. And there is a thing such as I have not heard of on Asian ground, nor as ever yet born in the great Dorian isle of Pelops: a plant unconquered, self-renewing, causing terror to destroying enemies. It greatly flourishes in this land—the gray-leafed olive, nurturer of children. Youth cannot harm it by the ravages of his hand, nor can any who lives with old age. For the sleepless eye of Zeus Morios watches over it, and gray-eyed Athena. And I have more praise for this city our mother, the gift of a great divinity, a glory most great: the might of horses, the might of colts, and the might of the sea. by establishing first in our roads the bit that cures the rage of horses. And the shapely oar, well-fitted for the sea, in flying past the land leaps to follow the hundred-footed Nereids. Land that is praised above all lands, now it is your task to make those bright praises seen in deeds! What strange new thing has happened, my daughter? Creon there draws near us, and not without followers, father. Ah, dearest old men, now give me the final proof of my salvation! Courage! It will be yours. For even if I am aged, this country’s strength has not grown old. Gentlemen, noble dwellers in this land, I see from your eyes that a sudden fear has troubled you at my coming; but do not shrink back from me, and let no evil word escape you. No, I have been sent, aged as I am, to plead with this man to return with me to the land of Cadmus. I am not one man’s envoy, but have a mandate from all our people; since it belonged to me, by family, beyond all other Thebans to mourn his woes. Unhappy Oedipus, hear us, and come home! Justly are you summoned by all the Cadmeans, and most of all by me, since I—unless I am the worst of all men born—feel most sorrow for your woes, old man, when I see you, unhappy as you are, a stranger and a wanderer evermore, roaming in beggary, with one handmaid for your support. Ah, me, I had not thought that she could fall to such a depth of misery as that to which she has fallen— this poor girl!—as she tends forever your dark life amid poverty; in ripe youth, but unwed: a prize for the first passerby to seize. But indeed an open shame cannot be hidden. Oedipus, in the name of your ancestral gods, listen to me! Hide it, and consent to return to the city and the house of your ancestors, after bidding a kind farewell to this city. since it was You who will dare anything, who from any just plea would derive a crafty trick, why do you make this attempt on me, and seek once more to snare me in your trap where I would feel most grief? Long ago, when I labored under the sickness of my self-made evils, and I yearned to be cast out of the land, you refused to grant the favor. But when my fierce anger had spent its force, and seclusion in the house was sweet to me, it was then that you thrust me from the house and cast me from the land. And this common race that you mention—that was not at all dear to you then. Now, in turn, when you see that I have a kindly welcome from this city and all its race, you try to pluck me away, wrapping your cruel thoughts in soft words. And yet what pleasure do you find in this, in treating me as dear against my will? As if a man should refuse you a gift, bring you no aid, when you continually begged for it; but after your heart was sated with your desires, he should grant it then, when the favor could bring no joy —would you not find your delight in this empty? Yet such is the nature of your own offers to me: noble in appearance, but in substance base. And I will declare it to these men too, to show you up as base. You have come to get me, not to bring me home, but to plant me near your borders, so that your city might escape uninjured by evils from this land. That fate is not for you, but this one: the brooding of my vengeful spirit on your land forever; and for my sons, this heirloom: just so much soil in my realm in which to die. and with a tongue keener than the edge of a sword; yet by their use you may well reap more sorrow than salvation. Still, since I know that I cannot persuade you of this, go! Allow us to live on here; for even in this plight our life would not be bad, if we should be content with it. Which of us, do you think, suffers more in this exchange—I by your action, or you by your own? For me, it is enough if your pleading fails both with me and with these men nearby. Unhappy man, will you let everyone see that even in your years you have gained no sense? Must you live on to disgrace your old age? You have a clever tongue, but I know no just man who can produce from every side a pretty speech. Words may be many, and yet not to the point. As if yours, indeed, were few, but on the mark. They cannot be, not for one whose mind is such as yours. Begone! I will say it for these men too. And do not besiege me with a jealous watch where I am destined to remain. I call these men, and not you, to witness the tenor of your words to your friends. And if I ever catch you— And who could catch me against the will of these allies? I promise you,  soon you will be pained even without that. Where is the deed which backs that threatening word? One of your two daughters I have myself just seized and sent away. The other I will drag off immediately. Oh, no! You will soon find more to weep about. You have my child? And I will have this one in no long time. Oh! Strangers, what will you do? Will you betray me? Will you not drive the godless man from this land? Depart, stranger! Quick! Your present deed is not just, nor the deed which you have done. It is time for you to drag this girl off against her will, if she will not go freely. Wretched that I am! Where can I flee? Where find help from gods or men? What are you doing, stranger? I will not touch this man, but her who is mine. Lords of the land! Stranger, you are acting unjustly. Justly. How? I take my own. Oh, city ! What are you doing, stranger? Release her! Your strength and ours will soon come to the test. Stand back! Not while this is your purpose. There will be war with Did I not say so? Unhand the girl at once! Do not make commands where you are not the master. Let go, I tell you! And I tell you: be off! Help, men of I am being dragged away in misery. Strangers, strangers! My child, where are you? I am led off by force. Give me your hand, my child! I am helpless. Away with you! I am wretched, wretched! So those two staffs will never again support your path. But since you wish to overcome your country and your friends, whose will I, though tyrant as well, am here discharging, then I wish you victory. For in time, I am sure, you will come to recognize all this, that now too as in time past, it is you who have done yourself no good, by indulging your anger despite your friends. This has always been your ruin. Stop there, stranger! Hands off, I say! I will not let go, unless you give back the maidens. Then you will soon give the city a more valuable prize, for I will lay hands on more than those two girls. What! What do you intend? This man here will be my captive. A valiant threat! Straightaway it will be done. Indeed, unless the ruler of this realm prevents you. Voice of shamelessness! Will you really lay hands on me? Shut up, I say! No! May the powers of this place grant me to utter this further curse! Most evil of men, when these eyes were dark, you wrenched from me the helpless one who was my eyesight and made off with her by force. Therefore to you and to your race may the Sun, the god who sees all things, grant in time an old age such as mine! Do you see this, people of the land? They see both you and me. They know that I have suffered in deeds, and my defense is mere words. I will not check my anger. Though I am alone and slow with age, I will take this man by force. Ah, my wretchedness! What arrogance you have come with, stranger, if you think you will achieve this! I will. Then I think this city no longer exists. For  men who are just, you see, the weak vanquishes the strong. Do you hear his words? Yes, but he will not achieve them. Zeus knows perhaps, but you do not. This is an outrage! An outrage which you must bear. Hear people, hear rulers of the land! Come quickly, come! These men are on their way to cross our borders! What is this shout? What is the trouble? What fear has moved you to stop my sacrifice at the altar to the sea-god, the lord of your here more swiftly than was pleasant. Dearest of men! I know your voice. Terrible are the things I have just suffered at the hands of this man here. What things are these? And who has pained you? Speak! Creon, whom you see here, has torn from me my children—my only two. What is that you say? You have heard my wrongs. Hurry, one of you attendants, to the altars there, and order the people to leave the sacrifice and race on foot and by horse full speed, to the region where the two highways meet, so that the maidens may not pass, and I not become a mockery to this stranger as one worsted by force. Quick, I say, away with you! As for this man, if my anger went as far as he deserves, I would not let him go uninjured from my hand. But now, just such law as he himself has brought will be the rule for his correction. You will never leave this land until you bring those maidens and produce them in my sight. For your action is a disgrace to me, and to your own ancestors, and to your country. You have come to a city that practices justice and sanctions nothing without law, yet you have spurned her lawful authorities and made this violent assault. You are taking captives at will and subjugating them by force, as if you believed that my city was void of men, or manned by slaves, and that I counted for nothing. nor would she praise you, if she learned that you are despoiling me, and despoiling the gods, when by force you drive off their unfortunate suppliants.  If my foot were upon your land, never would I drag off or lead away someone without permission from the ruler of the land, whoever he might be—no, even if my claim were the most just of all. I would know how a stranger ought to live among citizens. But you are disgracing a city that does not deserve it: your own, and your years, despite their fullness, bring you an old age barren of sense. These are the words of my lips; my mind is in accord. Do you see your plight, stranger? You are judged to be just by where you are from, but your deeds are found to be evil. It is not because I thought this city void of men, son of Aegeus, or of counsel, as you say, that I have done this deed; but because I judged that its people could never be so zealous for my relatives as to support them against my will. And I knew that this people would not receive a parricide and a polluted man, a man whose unholy marriage—a marriage with children—had been found out. Such wisdom, I knew, was immemorial on the Areopagus, which does not allow such wanderers to dwell within this city. Trusting in that, I sought to take this prize. And I would not have done so, had he not been calling down bitter curses on me and on my race. As I was wronged in this way, I judged that I had a right to this requital. For anger knows no old age, until death comes; the dead alone feel no galling pain. Shameless arrogance, where do you think this outrage falls—on my old age, or on your own? Bloodshed, incest, misery—all this your tongue has launched against me, and all this I have borne in my wretchedness by no choice of mine. For this was dear to the gods, who were angry, perhaps, with my race from of old. Taking me alone, you could not find a reproach for any crime, in retribution for which I was driven to commit these sins against myself and against my kin. Tell me now: if, by the voice of an oracle, some divine doom was coming on my father, that he should die by a son’s hand, how could you justly reproach me with this, when I was then unborn, when no father had yet begotten me, no mother’s womb conceived me? But if, having been born to misery—as I was born—I came to blows with my father and slew him, ignorant of what I was doing and to whom, how could you reasonably blame the unwitting deed? For I will not be silent, when you have gone so far in impious speech. Yes, she was my mother, yes—alas, for my miseries! I did not know it, nor did she, and to her shame she bore children to the son whom she had borne. But one thing, at least, I know: that you willingly revile her and me, but I did not willingly marry her, and I do not willingly speak now. Answer just one thing of those I ask. If, here and now, someone should come up and try to murder you—you, the just one—would you ask if the murderer was your father, or would you revenge yourself on him straightaway? I think that if your life is dear to you, you would requite the criminal, and not look around for a justification. Such then were the evils into which I came, led by the gods; and in this, I think, my father’s soul, could it come back to life, would not contradict me. But you are not just; you are one who considers it a fine thing to utter every sort of word, both those which are sanctioned and those which are forbidden—such are your taunts against me in the presence of these men. And to you it seems a fine thing to flatter the renowned Theseus, and Yet while giving such generous praise, you forget that if any land knows how to worship the gods with honors, this land excels in that. It is from her that you had planned to steal me, a suppliant and an old man, and tried to seize me, having already carried off my daughters. Therefore I now call on the goddesses here, I supplicate them, I beseech them with prayers, to bring me help and to fight on my behalf, that you may learn well what kind of men this city is guarded by. The stranger is a good man, lord. His fate has been accursed, but it is worthy of our aid. Enough of words. The doers of the deed are in flight, while we, the sufferers, stand still. What order, then, do you have for a powerless man? Guide the way on the path to them while I escort you, in order that if you are keeping the maidens whom we seek in these lands, you yourself may reveal them to me. But if your men are fleeing with the spoils in their grasp, we may spare our trouble; the chase is for others, from whom they will never escape out of this land to thank their gods. Come, lead the way! And know that the captor has been captured; fate has seized you as you hunted. Gains unjustly got by guile are soon lost. And you will have no ally in your purpose; for I well know that it is not without accomplice or resource that you have come to such outrage, from the daring mood which has inspired you here. There was someone you were trusting in when you did these deeds. This I must consider, and I must not make this city weaker than one man. Do you take my drift? Or do these words seem as empty as the warnings given when you were laying your plans? Say what you wish while you are here; I will not object. But at home I too will know how to act. Make your threats, then, but go forward. As for you, Oedipus, stay here in peace with my pledge that, unless I die beforehand, I will not cease until I put you in possession of your children. Thanks to you, Theseus, for your nobleness and your righteous care for me! Oh, to be where the enemy, turned to fight, will soon join in Ares’ clash of bronze, by the shores of Apollo, perhaps, or by that torch-lit beach where the Great Goddesses maintain awful rites for mortals on whose lips the ministering Eumolpidae have laid the golden seal of silence. There, I think, the war-rousing Theseus and the two maiden sisters will soon meet within our borders, amid the war-cry of resisting men! Or perhaps they will soon draw near to the pastures on the west of Oea’s snowy rock, fleeing on young horses or in chariots racing full speed. He will be caught! Terrible is the neighboring Ares, terrible the might of the followers of Theseus. Yes, the steel of every bridle flashes, and against their opponents charges forward our whole cavalry, who honor horse-riding Athena, and the earth-girdling Sea-god, the dear son of Rhea. Is the battle now or yet to be? For somehow my mind presages to me that soon I will meet the maidens who have suffered fearfully, who have found fearful suffering at the hands of a kinsman. I predict noble struggles. Oh, to be a dove with the strength and swiftness of a whirlwind, that I might reach an airy cloud, and hang my gaze above the fight! Hear, all-ruling lord of the gods, all-seeing Zeus! Grant to the guardians of this land to achieve with triumphant might the capture that gives the prize into their hands! And may your daughter grant it too, dread Pallas Athena! And Apollo, the hunter, and his sister, who follows the spotted, swift-footed deer—I wish that they would come, a double help to this land and to its people. Wandering stranger, you will not say your watcher was a false prophet, for I see your daughters once again drawing near. Where? Where? What is that? What do you mean? Father, father, I wish some god would grant that your eyes might see this excellent man, who has brought us here to you! My child, are you really here? Yes, for these strong arms have saved us—Theseus and his dearest followers. Come here, my children, to your father! Grant me your embrace—restored beyond all hope! We shall grant your wish, for we crave the favor we bestow. Where, then, where are you? Here we are, approaching you together. Dearest offspring! Everything is dear to its parent. Supports of a man— Ill-fated as he is ill-fated. I hold my dearest. Now, if I should die, I would not be wholly wretched, since you have come to me. Press close to me on either side, children, cling to your father, and rest from your wandering, so desolate, so grievous! And tell me what has happened as briefly as you can, since brief speech suffices for young maidens. Here is our savior: you should hear the story from him, father, since the deed was his. So short will by part be. Stranger, do not be amazed at my persistence, if I prolong my words to my children, found again beyond my hope. I well know that my present joy in them has come to me from you, and you alone, for you—and not any other mortal—have rescued them. May the gods grant to you my wish, both to you yourself and to this land; for among you, above all mankind, I have found piety, the spirit of decency, and lips that tell no lie. I know these things, and I repay them with these words; for what I have, I have through you, and no one else. Stretch out to me your right hand, lord, that I may touch it; and if it is right, let me kiss your cheek. But what am I saying? Wretched as I have become, how could I wish you to touch a man in whom every stain of evils has made its dwelling? I will not touch you—nor will I allow it, if you do consent. They alone, who know them, can share these burdens. Receive my greeting where you stand, and in the future too give me your righteous care, as you have given it  up to this hour. I feel no amazement, if you have had a lengthy conversation from joy in these children, or if your first concern has been for their words rather than for me. Indeed, there is nothing to vex me in that. Not with words so much as with deeds would I add luster to my life. You have this proof: I have cheated you in none of my sworn promises, old man. Here am I, with the maidens living, uninjured by those threats. As to how the struggle was won, what need have I vainly to boast of what you will learn from these two when you are together? But there is a matter that has just presented itself to me, as I came here. Give me your counsel regarding it; for, though it is small, it is food for wonder. And mortal man must consider nothing beneath his concern. What is it, son of Aegeus? Tell me; I myself know nothing of what you inquire. They say a man—not from your city, yet of your race—has somehow thrown himself down, as a suppliant, at our altar of Poseidon, where I was sacrificing when I first set out here. What land does he come form? What does he desire by his supplication? I know one thing only: they tell me he asks to speak briefly with you, a thing of no great burden. On what topic? That suppliant state is of no small account. He asks, they say, no more than that he may confer with you, and return unharmed from his journey here. Who can he be that implores the god in this way? Consider whether there is anyone in your race at Dearest friend, say no more! What is wrong? Do not ask me for— For what? Speak! From hearing these things I know who the suppliant is. And who can he be, that I should have an objection to him? My son, lord, a hated son whose words would vex my ear like the words of no man besides. What? Can you not listen, without doing what you do not wish to do? Why does it pain you to hear him? Lord, that voice has become most hateful to his father. Do not constrain me to yield in this. But consider whether his suppliant state constrains you; what if you have a duty of respect for the god? Father, listen to me; I will offer counsel though I am young. Allow this man here to gratify his own feelings and the god as he wishes, and for your daughters’ sake allow our brother to come. He will not tear you by force from your resolve—never fear—with such words as will not be for your good. What harm can there be in listening to words? Deeds wickedly devised, as you know, are betrayed by speech. You sired him, so, even if he wrongs you with the most impious of wrongs, father, it is not right for you to wrong him in return. Look to the past, away from the present; consider all the pains that you have suffered through your father and mother. If you consider those things, I know well that you will perceive that what results from an evil anger is evil.  Your reasons to reflect on this are not trivial, bereft of your unseeing eyes. My child, by your pleading you overcome me; but your pleasure here is my grief. Still, let it be as is dear to you. Only, if that man is to come here, stranger, let no one ever become master over my soul. Once only do I need hear such words, and no more, old man. I do not want to boast, but you may feel sure that your life is safe, while any of the gods preserves mine. Whoever craves the longer length of life, not content to desire a moderate span, him I will judge with no uncertainty: he clings to folly. For the long years lay in deposit many things nearer to pain than joy; but as for your delights, you will find them nowhere, when someone’s life has fallen beyond the fitting period. The Helper comes at last to all alike, when the fate of Hades is suddenly revealed, without  marriage-song, or lyre, or dance: Death at the end. Not to be born is, beyond all estimation, best; but when a man has seen the light of day, this is next best by far, that with utmost speed he should go back from where he came. what hard affliction is foreign to him, what suffering does he not know? Envy, factions, strife, battles, and murders. Last of all falls to his lot old age, blamed, weak, unsociable, friendless, wherein dwells every misery among miseries. In such years is this poor man here, not I alone. Like some cape that fronts the north which is lashed on every side by the waves of winter, so he also is fiercely lashed evermore by the dread disasters that break on him like the surf, some from the region of the setting sun, some from that of its rising, some in the realm of its noon-time rays, some from the gloom-wrapped hills of the North. Look, the stranger, it seems, is coming here to us. Yes, without attendants, father, with tears streaming from his eyes. Who is he? The very man who was in our thoughts from the first. Polyneices has come to us. Ah, me, what should I do? Should I weep first for my own woes, sisters, or for those of my father here, in his old age? I have found him in a foreign land, here with you two as an exile, clad in such garments as these. Their unfriendly filth has resided with the old man for long, wasting his flesh; while above the sightless eyes the unkempt hair flutters in the breeze; and matching with these things, it seems, is the food that he carries, sustenance for his poor stomach. And I bear witness that I have proved the worst of men in all that concerns care for you; from my own lips hear what I am. But seeing that Zeus himself in all his actions has Shame beside him to share his throne, may she come to your aid too, father. For the sins committed can be healed, but can never be made worse. Seed of this man, my sisters, you at least must try to move our father’s implacable, inexorable silence, so that he may not send me away like this, dishonored and with no word in return, when I am the suppliant of the god. Tell him yourself, unhappy man, what you have come to seek. When words flow, you know, they may give joy, or incite anger or pity, and so they may give a voice to the mute. Then I will speak boldly, for you give me excellent guidance, first claiming the help of the god himself, from whose altar the king of this land raised me to come to you, with a guarantee to speak and hear, and go my way unharmed. And I wish these pledges, strangers, to be kept with me by you, and by my sisters here, and by my father. But now I want to tell you, father, why I came. Therefore Eteocles, though the younger, thrust me from the land, when he had neither defeated me by an argument of law, nor made a trial of might and deed. He brought over the city by persuasion. The cause of this, I claim, is most of all the curse on your house; I also hear this from soothsayers. For when I came to Dorian Argos, I made Adrastus my father-in-law. And I bound to me by oath all men of the Apian land who are foremost in their renown for war, so that with their aid I might collect the seven armies of spearmen against my own prayers and those of my allies, who now with seven armies behind their seven spears have set their blockade around the plain of then comes the son of Oeneus, Aetolian Tydeus; Eteoclus is third, of He is named for that virgin of long ago from whose marriage in later time he was born, the trusty son of Atalanta. Last come I, your son—or if not yours, then the offspring of an evil fate, but yours at least in name— leading the fearless army of who has expelled me and robbed me of my fatherland. For if anything trustworthy comes from oracles, they said that whoever you join with in alliance will have victorious strength. I am a beggar and a stranger, as you are yourself; by paying court to others both you and I have a home, obtaining by lot the same fortune. But he is tyrant at home—wretched me!—and in his pride laughs at you and me alike. But if you join as ally to my purpose, with little trouble or time I will scatter his strength to the winds, so that I will bring you home and set you in your own house, and set me in mine, when I have cast him out by force. If you are with me, then I can make this boast; but without you I cannot even return alive. For the sake of him who has sent this man, Oedipus, speak what seems good to you, before you send him away. Guardians of this land, if it were not Theseus who had sent him here to me, thinking it just that he should hear my response, then never would he have heard my voice of prophecy. But now he will be graced with it, before he goes, and hear from me such words as never will gladden his life. Worst of men, when you had the scepter and the throne, which now your brother has in The time for tears is past. I must bear this burden as long as I live, and keep you before my mind as a murderer. For it is you that have made me subject to this anguish; it is you that have thrust me out, and because of you I wander, begging my daily bread from strangers. And had these daughters not been born to me to be my comfort, in truth I would be dead, for lack of help from you. But now these girls preserve me; they are my nurses; they are men, not women, in sharing my toil. But you are from another and are no sons of mine. Therefore the divinity looks upon you—not yet as he soon will look, if indeed those armies of yours are moving against Such curses as my heart before now sent up against you both, I now invoke to fight for me, in order that you may think it fit to revere your parents and not to dishonor your father utterly, because he who begot such sons is blind. For my daughters here did not act in this way. This supplication of yours, and this throne of yours, will lie in the power of my curses, if indeed Justice, revealed long ago, sits beside Zeus, to share his throne through sanction of primordial laws. Take these curses which I call down on you, most evil of evil men: may you never defeat your native land, and may you never return to the valley of And I call on the hateful darkness of Tartarus that your father shares, to take you into another home; and I call on the divinities of this place, and I call on the god of war, who has set dreadful hatred in you both. Go with these words in your ear; go and announce to all the Cadmeans, and to your own faithful allies, that Oedipus has distributed such portions to his sons. Polyneices, in your past travels I take no joy. Now go back with speed. Alas, for my journey and my failed attempt! Alas, for my companions! Such is the end of the road on which we set out from But you, daughters of this man and my sisters, since you hear these hard curses of a father, do not—if this father’s curses be fulfilled and you find some way of return to Thebes—do not, I beg you by the gods, leave me dishonored, but give me burial and due funeral rites.  So the praise which you now win from this man here for your labors will be increased by another praise no less, through your care for me. Polyneices, I beseech you, hear me in one thing! What is it, dearest Antigone? Speak! Turn your force back to Argos as quickly as may be, and do not destroy both yourself and your city. No, it is not possible. For how could I lead the same force again, when once I had shrunk back? But why, my brother, must your anger rise again? What profit will come to you from destroying your native land? It is shameful to be in exile, and to be mocked in this way by my brother, when I am eldest-born. Do you see to what sure fulfillment the prophecies of this man are leading, who declares mutual death for you two? Yes, for he wishes it. But I must not yield. Ah, wretched me! But who will dare follow you, when he hears what prophecies this man has uttered? I will not report ill-tidings; a good leader should tell the better news, and not the worse. Is this then your fixed decision, my brother? Yes, and do not detain me. This path now will be my destiny, ill-fated and evil, because of my father here and his Furies. But as for you two, may Zeus grant you good things, if you bring these things to completion for me when I am dead, since in life you will see me no more. Now release me, and farewell; for nevermore will you behold me living. Ah, wretched that I am! Do not mourn for me. And who would not mourn you, brother, when you are hurrying off to a death foreseen? If it is fated, then I must die. No, no, listen to my prayer! Do not plead for what must not be. Then I, indeed, am utterly wretched, if I must lose you! It rests with the divinity, this way or that. But as for you two, I pray to the gods that you may never meet with evil; for in all men’s eyes you do not deserve to suffer. Behold, new ills of heavy fate have newly come from the blind stranger, unless, perhaps, fate is finding its goal. I cannot say that a purpose of the divinities is ever vain. Time sees all things forever, and raises up some things, then on the next day raises others back up again. The sky resounds! Zeus! Children, children! If there is any man still here, send him forth to bring back Theseus, excellent in all respects. And what, father, is the purpose of your summons? This winged thunder of Zeus will soon lead me to Hades. So send someone with speed. Listen! With a louder noise this one crashes down unspeakably, hurled by Zeus! The hair of my head stands up for fear, my soul is dismayed; for again the lightning flashes in the sky. What end will it release? I fear it, for never does it fly forth in vain, or without serious results. O great Sky! O Zeus! Children, the appointed end of life has reached this man; he can turn from it no more. How do you know? By what means do you understand this? I know it well. But let some one go, I pray you, as quickly as he can, and bring back the lord of this land. Look! Look! Once again the piercing din is around us! Be merciful, divinity, be merciful, if you are bringing anything of gloom for the land which is our mother! May I find you well disposed, and may I not, because I have cared for a man accursed, somehow obtain a favor without profit! Lord Zeus, to you I cry! Is the man near? Will he find me still alive, children, and master of my senses? And what is the pledge that you would like to have firm in your mind? In return for his benefits, I would grant him the fulfillment of the favor that I promised. Hurry, my son, come to us! If you chance to be in the glade sacrificing an ox to the sea-god Poseidon, then come! For the stranger thinks you worthy, you and your city and your friends, to receive just return for benefits. Hasten quickly, lord! What din is this that once more rings forth from you all, from my people as clearly as from the stranger? Can a thunderbolt from Zeus be the cause, or rushing hail in its fierce onset? When the god sends such a storm, forebodings of every sort may find a place. Lord, you have appeared at my desire, and to you some god granted noble fortune at this coming. And what new thing has now occurred, son of Laius? My life hangs in the balance; and I wish to die without cheating you and this city of the promises I made. And what is the proof of your fate that you depend on? The gods themselves herald the news to me, nor do they cheat me of any of the appointed signs. What makes these things clear? Tell me, old man. The thunder, crash after crash; the lightning, flash after flash, hurled from the unconquered hand. I am persuaded, for in much I find you a prophet whose voice is not false. Then say what must be done. I will expound myself, son of Aegeus, the treasures which will be laid up for this city, such as age can never hurt. Immediately, with no hand to guide me, I will lead to the place where I must die. But as to that place, never reveal it to another man, neither where it is hidden, nor in what region it lies, so that it may be an eternal defence for you, better than many shields, better than the spear of neighbors which brings relief. But as for mysteries which speech may not profane, you will learn them yourself when you come to that place alone, since I cannot declare them either to any of these people, or even to my own children, though I love them. Reserve them always to yourself, and when you reach the end of life, reveal them to your eldest son alone, and let him reveal them to his successor in turn forever. even though their neighbor commits no sin. For the gods are slow to punish, yet they are sure, when men scorn holiness and turn to frenzy. Do not desire this, son of Aegeus! But you know such things as these without my teaching. Let us now set forth to that place—the divine summons urges me—and hesitate no longer. Children, follow me. For now in turn it is I that shine forth wondrously as a leader for you, as you were your father’s. Onward. Do not touch me, but allow me unaided to find the sacred tomb where it is my fate to be buried in this land. but now my body feels you for the last time! For now I go to hide the end of my life in the house of Hades. But you, dearest of strangers, may you yourself be prosperous, and this land, and your followers. In your prosperity, remember me in my death, and be fortunate evermore. If it is right for me with prayer to adore the Unseen Goddess and you, Lord of the Dead, then hear me, Aidoneus, Aidoneus! Grant that without pain, without a fate arousing heavy grief, the stranger may pass to the all-concealing fields of the dead below, and to the Stygian house. Many were the sorrows that came to him without cause, but a just divinity will lift him up again. Goddesses of the nether world and unconquered beast whose lair lies in the gates of many guests, you untamable Watcher of Hades, snarling from the cavern’s jaws, as rumor has always told! Hear me, Death, son of Earth and Tartarus! May that Watcher leave a clear path for the stranger on his way to the nether fields of the dead! To you I call, giver of the eternal sleep. Citizens, my news might be summed up most briefly thus: Oedipus is dead. But the story of the happening cannot be told in brief words, as the deeds done there were not brief. Is he gone, the unfortunate man? You may be sure that he has left this life. How? By a fate divine and painless, the poor man? In that you touch upon what is indeed worthy of wonder. How he departed from here, you yourself must know since you were here: with no one of his friends as guide, but rather with himself leading the way for us all. When he had come to the Descending Way, which is bound by steps of bronze to earth’s deep roots, he paused at one of the many branching paths near the basin in the rock, where the faithful covenant of Theseus and Peirithous has its memorial. He stood midway between that basin and the Leaping stone, and between the hollow pear-tree and the marble tomb; then he sat down and loosened his filthy clothing. They went to the hill which was in view, the hill of Demeter who guards the tender plants, and in a short time brought what their father had commanded. Then they washed him and dressed him, as is the custom. and nothing that he required was still undone, then Zeus of the Underworld sent forth his thunder, and the maidens shuddered as they heard. They fell weeping at their father’s knees, and did not cease from beating their breast, and from wailing loud. When he heard their sudden bitter cry, he put his arms around them and said: In this way, clinging close to one another, the father and his daughters sobbed and wept. But when they came to the end of their crying, and the sound of wailing went forth no more, there was a silence; suddenly a voice called aloud to him, so that everyone felt hair rising from the sudden terror. The god called him again and again: he asked that lord Theseus should come to him; and when he did, he said: And he, as a man of noble spirit, without lamentation swore to keep that promise to the stranger. So he spoke, and everyone of us listened; with streaming tears and mourning we followed the maidens away. But when we had gone off, very soon we looked back and saw that Oedipus was nowhere any more and our lord was alone, holding his hand in front of his face to screen his eyes, as if he had seen some terrifying sight, one that no one could endure to behold. And then after a short time, we saw him adore together the earth and nor any rising of whirlwind from the sea; it was either an escort from the gods, or else the dark world of the dead kindly split open to receive him. The man passed away without lamentation or sickness or suffering, and beyond all mortal men he was wondrous. And if in anyone’s eyes I seem to speak senselessly, I would not try to win his belief when he counts me senseless. Where are his daughters and the escort of their friends? Not far away; the sounds of mourning show plainly that they are approaching. Ah, me, ah, me! Now, indeed, is it for us to bewail in full the curse on our blood—ill-fated sisters as we are—deriving from our father! In former time we bore the long toil without pause, and now at the last we bring to tell a sight and experience that baffle reason. What is it? It is possible to conjecture, friends. He is gone? Precisely in the way you could most wish for: indeed, in a way in which neither Ares took him, nor the sea, but instead he was snatched away to the fields which no one may see, by some swift, strange doom. Wretched me! For us a night like death has descended on our eyes; how shall we find our hard livelihood, roaming to some far land, or on the waves of the sea? I do not know. If only murderous Hades would join me in death to my aged father! Wretched me! I cannot live the life that must be mine. Best of daughters, you both must bear the will of the gods. Do not be inflamed with too much grief; what you have encountered is not to be blamed. There is longing even for woes. What was in no way dear was dear, so long as I held him in my embrace. Father, Dear, clothed in the darkness of the underworld forever! Never in your absence will you not be dear to me and to my sister here. He fared— He fared as he desired. In what way? He died on the foreign ground that he desired; he has his well-shaded bed beneath the ground for ever; and he did not leave behind unwept sorrow. With these weeping eyes, father, I lament you; nor do I know how in my wretchedness I must still my grief for you that is so immense. Alas! You wanted to die in a foreign land, but you died without me near. Wretched me! What fate awaits you and me, dear, orphaned as we are of our father? Cease from your grief, dear girls, since his end is blessed. No one is beyond the reach of evil. Dear, let us hasten back. To do what deed? A longing fills my soul— For what? To see the netherworld home. Of whom? Wretched me! Of our father. And how can this be right? Surely you understand? Why this rebuke? And surely you know this, too— What more would you tell me? That he perished without a tomb, apart from everyone. Lead me there, and then kill me, too. Unhappy me! Abandoned and helpless, where am I now to live my wretched life? Dear girls, do not be afraid. But where shall I flee? Already a refuge has been found— What do you mean? —That no harm befall you. I feel— What do you think? How we are to go home, I cannot tell. Do not seek to go. Trouble surrounds us. And previously it bore heavily. Then it was desperate, but now even crueler. Vast, then, is the sea of your troubles. Alas, alas! Zeus, where shall we turn? To what last hope does the divinity now drive us? Cease your lament, children! Where the favor of the nether night is stored up, there is no room for sorrow; divine retribution would follow. Son of Aegeus, we supplicate you! To obtain what desire, my children? We want look with our own eyes upon our father’s tomb. It is not right to go there. What do you mean, lord, ruler of Children, he told me that no one should draw near that place, or approach with prayer the sacred tomb in which he sleeps. He said that, so long as I saw to this, I would always keep the country free from pain. The divinity heard me say these things, as did the all-seeing Oath of Zeus. If this is his intention, we must be content with it. Send us to ancient I will do both this and whatever other favorable service I can, for you and for the newly-departed under the earth, according to the gratitude I owe. I am bound to spare no pains. Cease; raise up the lamentation no further. These things are established firm and fixed.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                There is nothing so terrible to describe, or suffering, or heaven-sent affliction, that human nature may not have to bear the burden of it. The blessed Tantalus—and I am not now taunting him with his misfortunes— Tantalus, the reputed son of Zeus, flies in the air, quailing at the rock which looms above his head; paying this penalty, they say, for the shameful weakness he displayed in failing to keep a bridle on his lips, when admitted by gods, though he was a man, to share the honors of their feasts like one of them. He begot Pelops, the father of Atreus, for whom the goddess, when she had carded her wool, spun a web of strife—to make war with his own brother Thyestes. But why need I retrace that hideous tale? Well, Atreus slew Thyestes’ children and feasted him on them. Atreus, now; I pass over intermediate events; from Atreus and Aerope of the gods’ abhorrence; while lord Agamemnon married Clytemnestra, notorious in who slew her husband, after snaring him in an inextricable robe. Her reason a maiden’s lips may not declare, and so I leave it unclear for the world to guess at. What need for me to charge Phoebus with wrong-doing? Though he persuaded Orestes to slay his own mother, a deed that few approved. Still it was his obedience to the god that made him kill her; I had a share in the murder, in so far as a woman could, After this my poor Orestes, wasting away in a cruel disease, lies fallen on his couch, and it is his mother’s blood that drives him round and round in frenzied fits; I am ashamed to name the goddesses, whose terrors are chasing him—the Eumenides. It is now the sixth day since the body of his murdered mother was committed to the cleansing fire; since then no food has gone down his throat, nor has he washed his skin; but wrapped in his cloak he weeps in his lucid moments, whenever the fever leaves him; at other times he bounds headlong from his couch, as a colt when it is loosed from the yoke. This city of whether we are both to die by stoning. after ceaseless wanderings; but Helen, that so-called lady of sorrows, he has sent on to our palace, waiting for the night, lest any of those parents whose sons died at Within she sits, weeping for her sister and the calamities of her family, and yet she has still some solace in her woe; for Hermione, the child she left at home when she sailed for and entrusted to my mother’s keeping, is still a cause of joy to her and a reason to forget her sorrows. I am watching each approach, until I see Menelaus arriving; for unless we find some safety from him, we have only a feeble anchor to ride on otherwise. A helpless thing, an unlucky house! Daughter of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon, unhappy Electra, a maiden for so long, how is it with you and your brother, this ill-starred Orestes who slew his mother? For referring the sin as I do to Phoebus, I incur no pollution by addressing you; and yet I am truly sorry for the death of my sister Clytemnestra, whom I never saw after I was driven by heaven-sent frenzy to sail as I did to but now that I am parted from her, I bewail our misfortunes. Helen, why should I speak of that which your own eyes can see? Beside his wretched corpse I sit, sleepless—for corpse he is, so faint his breath— not that I reproach him with his sufferings; but you are highly blessed and your husband too. How long has he lain in this way on the couch? Ever since he spilt his mother’s blood. Unhappy wretch! unhappy mother! what a death she died. Unhappy enough to succumb to his misery. By the gods, would you hear me a moment, maiden? Yes, with such leisure as this watching over a brother leaves. Will you go for me to my sister’s tomb? Would you have me seek my mother’s tomb? Why? To carry an offering of hair and a libation from me. Isn’t it right for you to go to the tomb of one you love? No, for I am ashamed to show myself in A late repentance surely for one who left her home so shamefully then. You have told the truth, but your telling is not kind to me. What is this supposed shame before the eyes of I am afraid of the fathers of those who lie dead at Good cause for fear; your name is on every tongue in Then free me of my fear and grant me this favor. I could not bear to look upon my mother’s grave. And yet it would be shame indeed for servants to bear these offerings. Then why not send your daughter Hermione? It is not good for maidens to go into a crowd. And yet she would be repaying her dead foster-mother’s care. You have told the truth and have convinced me, maiden. a mingled cup of honey, milk, and frothing wine; then stand upon the heaped-up grave, and say this: towards me and you and my husband; towards these two wretched sufferers, too, whom the gods have destroyed. And promise that I will pay in full whatever funeral gifts are due from me to a sister. Now go, my child, and hurry; and soon as you have made the libations at the tomb, think of your return. O human nature, how great an evil you are in men! and what salvation, too, to those who have a goodly heritage there. Did you see how she cut off her hair only at the ends, to preserve its beauty? She is the same woman as of old. May the gods hate you! for you have proved the ruin of me and my brother and all Alas! here are my friends once more, coming to unite their plaintive dirge with mine; they will soon put an end to my brother’s peaceful sleep, and cause my tears to flow when I see him in  frenzy. Hush, hush! let your footsteps fall lightly! not a sound! Go further from his couch, further, I beseech you! There, I obey. Ah, ah! Speak like the breath of a slender reed-pipe, my dear, I pray. See, how soft and low I drop my voice. Yes, do so; approach now, softly, softly! Give me an account of why you have come here. For at last he has lain down, and sleeps. How is he? You give us an account, my dear; what has happened, what misfortune? He is still breathing, but his moans grow feeble. What are you saying? You will kill him, if you disturb him from the sweet sleep he now enjoys. Poor sufferer, for his hateful deeds, inspired by a god! Ah, misery! Injustice it was, after all, from an unjust mouth, when Loxias on the tripod of Themis decreed my mother’s most unnatural murder. Do you see? He stirs beneath his robe! Alas! Your noisy chatter has roused him from his sleep. No, I think he is asleep. Leave us, go away from the house! circle back again! cease this noise! He is asleep. You are right. giver of sleep to hard-working mortals, come from Erebus, come, wing your way to the palace of Agamemnon. For with misery and woe we are lost, we are gone. There! away from his couch; let him enjoy his sleep in peace, my dear! Tell me, what end of troubles awaits him. Death, death; what else? For he has no desire for food. Then his destiny is already clear. Phoebus offered us up for sacrifice, when he ordered the pitiable, unnatural murder of our mother, who killed our father. It was just. But it was not well done. You killed and were killed, my mother! and you have slain a father and your own children; for we are dead or as good as dead. You are in your grave, and the greater part of my life is spent in weeping and wailing, and tears at night; unmarried, childless, I drag out forever a joyless existence. Electra, you are nearby; see whether your brother has not died without your knowing it; for I do not like his utter prostration. Sweet charm of sleep, savior in sickness, how sweetly you came to me, how needed! Revered forgetfulness of troubles, how wise a goddess you are, and invoked by every suffering soul!  My dearest, how glad I was to see you fall asleep! Do you want me take you in my arms and lift your body? Take, oh! take me in your arms, and from this sufferer’s mouth and eyes wipe off the flakes of foam. There! The service is sweet, and I do not refuse to tend a brother’s limbs with a sister’s hand. Prop me up, your side to mine; brush the matted hair from my face, for I see dimly. Ah, poor head, how dirty your hair! How savage you look, remaining so long unwashed! Put me once more upon the couch; whenever the madness leaves me, I am unnerved and weak.  a painful possession, but a necessary one. Set me upright once again, turn my body round; it is their helplessness that makes the sick so hard to please. Will you set your feet upon the ground and take a step at last? Change is always pleasant. Oh, yes; for that has a semblance of health; and the semblance is preferable, though it is far from the truth. Hear me now, my brother, while the Furies permit you to use your senses. You have news to tell; if it is good, you do me a kindness; but if it tends to my hurt, I have suffered enough. Menelaus, your father’s brother, has come; his ships are moored in What did you say? Has he come to be a light in our troubles, a man of our own family, who owes gratitude to our father? He has come, and is bringing Helen from the walls of Troy—accept this as proof of what I say. If he had returned alone in safety, he would be more enviable; but if he is bringing his wife, he has come with great mischief. Tyndareus begot a race of daughters notorious for blame, infamous throughout Then you be different from that evil brood, for you can be; and not only in words, but also in heart. Ah! brother, your eye is growing wild, and in a moment you are turning mad again, when you were just now sane. Mother, I implore you! Do not shake at me those maidens with their bloodshot eyes and snaky hair. Here they are, close by, to leap on me! Lie still, poor sufferer, on your couch; your eye sees nothing, you only imagine that you recognize them. O Phoebus! they will kill me, the hounds of hell, death’s priestesses with glaring eyes, the dreadful goddesses. I will not let you go; but with arms twined round you, I will prevent your piteous leaping. Let me go! you are one of my Furies, and are gripping me by the waist to hurl me into Tartarus! Alas for me! What aid can I find, when we have Heaven’s forces set against us? Give me my horn-tipped bow, Apollo’s gift, with which he told me to ward off the goddesses, if ever they sought to scare me with wild transports of madness. A mortal hand will wound one of them, unless she departs from my sight. Don’t you hear me? Don’t you see the feathered arrows springing out from my far-shooting bow? What! Do you linger still? Mount the sky on your wings, and blame those oracles of Phoebus. Ah! why am I raving,  gasping? Where, oh! where have I leapt, from my couch? Once more the storm is past, I see a calm. Sister, why do you weep, your head wrapped in your robe? I am ashamed that I should make you a partner in my sufferings and distress a maiden like you through my sickness. Do not waste away over my troubles; for though you consented to it, yet I was the one that spilled our mother’s blood. I blame Loxias, for urging me on to do a deed most unholy, encouraging me with words but not in deed. I believe that, if I had asked my father to his face whether I must slay my mother, he would have strongly entreated me, by this beard, never to plunge a  sword into her throat, since he would not regain his life, and I, poor wretch, would accomplish such evil! And now, my sister, unveil your face and cease to weep, despite our misery. Whenever you see me give way to despair, it is for you to calm and soothe the terrors and distorted fancies of my brain. Whenever sorrow comes to you, I must be at your side and give you comforting advice; for to help our friends like this is noble. Go in the house now, my poor sister; lie down and close your sleepless eyes; take food and bathe your body. For if you leave me or fall sick from nursing me, I am lost. You are my only ally; I am deserted by all the rest, as you see. I will not leave you; with you I will choose to live and die; for it is the same: if you die, what shall I, a woman, do? How shall I escape alone, with no brother, or father, or friends? Still, if you think it right, I must do your bidding. But lie down upon your couch, and do not pay too great heed to the terrors and alarm that scare you from your rest; lie still upon your pallet. For even if you are not sick, but only think you are, this brings weariness and perplexity to mortals. Ah! ah! you goddesses swiftly careering on your wings, whose lot it is to hold a revel, not with Bacchic rites, in tears and groans; you black-skinned avenging spirits, that dart along the spacious air, exacting a penalty for blood, a penalty for murder, I beg you, I beg you! Allow the son of Agamemnon to forget his wild whirling frenzy. Alas for the toils which you, poor wretch, strove after to your ruin, when you heard the voice from the tripod, proclaimed by Phoebus, at his sanctuary, where the hollows are called the navel of the earth. O Zeus! What pity, what deadly struggle is here, hurrying you on, the wretch on whom some avenging fiend is heaping tears upon tears, bringing to the house your mother’s blood, which drives you raving mad? Great prosperity is not secure among mortals. I lament, I lament! But some divine power, shaking it to and fro like the sail of a swift ship, plunges it deep in the waves of grievous affliction, violent and deadly as the waves of the sea. For what other family must I still revere, rather than the one from a divine marriage, from Tantalus. And see, a king draws near, lord Menelaus; from his magnificence it is plain to see that he belongs to the blood of the Tantalids. All hail! you that set out with a thousand ships to for you have accomplished, with divine aid, all that you prayed for. O my home, some joy I feel to see you again on my return from For I learned Agamemnon’s fate and the death he died at his wife’s hands, as I was trying to put in at Malea; when the sailors’ prophet, the truthful god Glaucus, Nereus’ seer, brought the news to me from the waves; he stationed himself in full view and told me this: my wife already on the point of starting here, I was expecting to give a fond embrace to Orestes, Agamemnon’s son, and his mother, thinking that they were doing well, when I heard from a sailor the unholy murder of Tyndareus’ child. And now tell me, young ladies, where to find the son of Agamemnon, who dared such evil. For he was a baby in Clytemnestra’s arms when I left my home to go to Menelaus, I am Orestes, whom you are asking about. I will of my own accord inform you of my sufferings. But as my first portion, I clasp your knees as a suppliant, giving you prayers from the mouth of one without the suppliant’s bough; save me, for you have come at the crisis of my troubles. O gods, what do I see? What living corpse greets my sight? You are right; I am dead through misery, though I still gaze upon the light. How savage the look your unkempt hair gives you, poor wretch! It is not my looks, but my deeds that torture me. Your tearless eyes glare dreadfully! My body is gone, though my name has not deserted me. Unsightly apparition, so different from what I expected! Here I am, the murderer of my wretched mother. I have heard, spare your words; evils should be seldom spoken. I will be sparing; but the deity is lavish of woe in my case. What ails you? what is your deadly sickness? My conscience; I know that I am guilty of a dreadful crime. What do you mean? Wisdom is shown in clarity, not in obscurity. Grief especially has ruined me— Yes, she is a dreadful goddess, yet are there cures for her. And fits of madness, the vengeance of a mother’s blood. When did your madness begin? Which day was it? On the day I was heaping the mound over my poor mother’s grave. When you were in the house, or watching by the pyre? As I was waiting by night to gather up her bones. Was any one else there, to help you rise? Pylades who shared with me the bloody deed, my mother’s murder. You are sick from phantom shapes; what sort? I seemed to see three maidens, black as night. I know whom you mean, but I do not want to name them. Yes, for they are revered; you were well-informed, to avoid naming them. Are these the ones that drive you to frenzy, with the curse of kindred blood? Oh! the torment I endure from their pursuit! It is not strange, if those who have done dreadful things should suffer them. But I have a way to recover from these troubles. Do not speak of death; that is not wise. It is Phoebus, who commanded me to kill my mother. Showing a strange ignorance of what is fair and right. We are slaves to the gods, whatever those gods are. And does Loxias not help your affliction? He will in time; this is the nature of gods. How long is it since your mother breathed her last? This is the sixth day; her funeral pyre is still warm. How soon the goddesses arrived to avenge your mother’s blood! I am not clever, but I am by nature a true friend to my friends. Does your father give you any help at all, for your avenging him? Not yet; I call delay the equal of inaction. How do you stand in the city after that deed of yours? I am so hated that no one will speak to me. Have your hands not even been cleaned of blood, according to custom? No, for wherever I go, the door is shut against me. Which citizens are driving you from the land? Oeax, who refers to my father his reason for hating I understand; he is avenging on you the blood of Palamedes. That was nothing to do with me; yet I am destroyed for three reasons. Who else? Some of the friends of Aegisthus, I suppose? They insult me, and the city listens to them now. Will the city allow you to keep the scepter of Agamemnon? How, seeing that they will not allow me to remain alive? What is their method? Can you tell me plainly? A vote will be taken against us today. To leave the city? Or to die, or not to die? Death by stoning at the hands of the citizens. Then why not cross the border and try to escape? Because we are encircled by men fully armed. Private foes or All the citizens, so that I may die; it is shortly told. Poor wretch! you have arrived at the extremity of woe. In you I have hopes of escape from my troubles. But since you have come with good fortune, share with your friends, who are wretched, your prosperity; do not hold aside that goodness for yourself alone; but partake of troubles in your turn, and so pay back my father’s kindness to those who have a claim on you. For such friends as desert us in adversity are friends in name but not in deed. And here is Tyndareus, the Spartan, struggling with aged step, clad in black robes, with his hair cut short in mourning for his daughter. Menelaus, I am ruined. See, Tyndareus approaches us, the man of all others I most shrink from facing, because of the deed I have done. For he nursed me when I was small, and lavished on me many a fond caress, carrying me about in his arms as the son of Agamemnon; and so did Leda; for they both honored me no less than the Dioscuri. Ah me! my wretched heart and soul, it was a sorry return I made them! What darkness can I find for my face? What cloud can I spread before me in my efforts to escape the old man’s eye? Where, where may I see Menelaus, my daughter’s husband? For as I was pouring libations on Clytemnestra’s grave I heard that he had come to and clasp his hand, as a friend whom at last I see again. Hail, old man, rival of Zeus for a bride! All hail to you, Menelaus, my kinsman!  Menelaus, are you speaking to that godless wretch? And why not? He is the son of one whom I loved. This is his son, this creature here? Yes, his son; if he is in misfortune, he ought to be honored. You have been so long among barbarians that you have become one of them. Always to honor one’s kin is a custom in And another custom is to yield a willing deference to the laws. The wise hold that everything which depends on necessity is a slave. Keep that wisdom for yourself; I will not have it. Yes, for you are angry, and also old age is not wise. What does a dispute about foolishness have to do with him? If right and wrong are clear to all, who was ever more senseless than this man, because he never weighed the justice of the case, nor appealed to the universal law of he should have brought a charge against his mother and inflicted a holy penalty for bloodshed, banishing her from his house; thus he would have gained moderation instead of calamity, keeping strictly to the law and showing his piety as well. As it is, he has come into the same fate as his mother. for though he had just cause for thinking her a wicked woman, he has become more wicked by murdering her. I will ask you, Menelaus, just one question. If a man’s wedded wife should kill him, and his son in turn will kill his mother in revenge; next the avenger’s son to expiate this murder will commit another: where will the chain of horrors end? Our forefathers settled these matters the right way. They forbade any one with blood upon his hands to appear in their sight or cross their path; but they purified him by exile, they did not kill him in revenge. Otherwise someone, by taking the pollution last upon his hands, is always going to be liable to have his own blood shed. Now I hate wicked women, especially my daughter who killed her husband; Helen, too, your own wife, I will never commend, nor would I even speak to her; and I do not envy you a voyage to which is always the ruin of countries and cities alike. One thing at least agrees with what I say: you are hated by the gods, and you pay atonement for your mother by  your fits of madness and terror. Why do I need to hear from other witnesses what I can see for myself? Therefore, Menelaus, take heed; do not oppose the gods in your wish to help this man; but leave him to be stoned to death by the citizens, or do not set foot on Spartan land. My daughter is dead, and rightly; but it should not have been his hand that slew her. In all except my daughters I have been a happy man; there I am not blessed. He is enviable, who is fortunate in his children, and does not bring hazardous notoriety on himself. Old man, I am afraid to speak before you, in a matter where I am sure to grieve you to the heart. I am unholy because I killed my mother, I know it, yet holy on another count, because I avenged my father. Only let your years, which frighten me from speaking, set no barrier in the path of my words, and I will go forward; but now I fear your gray hairs. What ought I to have done? Set one thing against another. My father begot me; your daughter gave me birth, being the field that received the seed from another; for without a father no child would ever be born. So I reasoned that I ought to stand by the author of my being rather than the woman who undertook to rear me. Now your daughter—I am ashamed to call her mother—came to a man’s bed in a private and unchaste wedding; I speak against myself when I speak badly of her, yet I will speak. Aegisthus was her secret husband in the home; I killed him, and I sacrificed my mother, an unholy  crime, no doubt, but done to avenge my father. Now, as regards the matters for which I deserve to be stoned as you threatened, hear the service I am conferring on all on any charge whatsoever. But I, by a horrible crime, as you boast it to be, have put an end to this custom. I hated my mother and killed her justly. She was false to her husband when he was gone from his home to fight for all and she did not keep his bed undefiled; and when her sin had found her out, she did not impose punishment on herself, but, to avoid paying the penalty to her husband, punished my father by death. By the gods! it is not a good time for me to mention the gods, when defending the charge of murder; but if I consented by my silence to my mother’s conduct, what would the murdered man have done to me? Would he not now in hatred be tormenting me with the Furies? Or does my mother have goddesses as allies, but he does not, in his deeper wrong? You, yes! you, old man, have been my ruin by begetting a wicked daughter; for it was owing to her audacious deed that I lost my father and became my mother’s murderer. You see, Telemachus did not kill the wife of Odysseus, because she did not marry husband upon husband, but the marriage-bed remained untainted in her home. And you see Apollo, who makes the navel of the earth his home, dispensing to mortals unerring prophecies, whom we obey in all he says; I killed my mother in obedience to him. Find him guilty of the crime, slay him; his was the sin, not mine. What ought I to have done? or is the god not competent to expiate the pollution when I refer it to him? Where then should anyone flee, if he will not rescue me from death after giving his commands? Do not say that the deed was done badly, but unfortunately for the ones who did it. A blessed life those mortals lead who make wise marriages; but those for whom it does not fall out well are unfortunate in their public and private concerns. Women by nature always meddle in the doings of men, with unfortunate results. Since you are so bold and suppress nothing, but answer me back in such a way as to vex my heart, you will lead me to go to greater lengths in procuring your execution; and I shall regard this as a fine addition to my labors in coming here to adorn my daughter’s grave. Yes, I will go to the chosen band of Argives and set the city, willing or not, on you and your sister, to pay the penalty of stoning. She deserves to die even more than you, for it was she who embittered you against your mother, always carrying tales to your ear to increase your hate the more, announcing dreams from Agamemnon, and  Aegisthus’ bed, may the gods in Hades loathe it! for even here on earth it was bitter; till she set the house ablaze with fires never kindled by Hephaestus. Menelaus, I tell you this, and I will do it, too: if you then consider my hatred or our marriage connection of any account, do not ward off this man’s doom in defiance of the gods, but leave him to be stoned to death by the citizens, or do not set foot on Spartan land. Remember you have been told all this, and do not choose the ungodly as friends, pushing aside the more righteous. Servants, lead me from this house. Go, so that the remainder of my speech may come to this man without interruption, free from your old age. Menelaus, why are you pacing round and round in thought, going back and forth, in a dilemma? Let me alone! When I think it over, I am perplexed to know where to turn in these events. Do not come to a final decision now, but after first hearing what I have to say, then make up your mind. Good advice! Speak. There are times when silence would be better than speech, and the reverse also. I will speak now. A long statement has advantages over a short one and is more intelligible to listen to. Give me nothing of your own, Menelaus, but repay what you received from my father. you will save my dearest possession. I have done wrong; I ought to have a little wrong-doing from you to requite that evil, for my father Agamemnon also did wrong in gathering the Hellenes and going to but he was trying to find a cure for the sin and wrong-doing of your wife. So this is one thing you are bound to pay me back. For he really gave his life, as friends should, toiling hard in battle with you, so that you might have your wife again. Pay back to me the same thing you got there. For one day exert yourself, on my behalf standing up in my defense, not ten full years. As for what For in my present plight, you must have an advantage over me and I must pardon it. But give to my miserable father my life and the life of my sister, a maiden so long; for by my death I shall leave my father’s house without an heir. You will say it is impossible. That’s the point; friends are bound to help friends in trouble. But when fortune gives of its best, what need of friends? For the god’s help is enough of itself when he is willing to give it. All and I am not saying this to flatter or wheedle you; by her I implore you.  is listening, that his spirit is hovering over you and saying what I say, this much for tears and groans and misfortunes. I have spoken and I have begged for my safety, hunting what all seek, not myself alone. I, too, though I am only a woman, beseech you to help those who need it; for you have the power. Orestes, you are a man for whom I have a deep regard, and I want to take part in your troubles; it is a duty, too, to help relatives bear their ills, by dying or killing enemies, if god gives the power to do so. I wish I had that power granted me by the gods. For I have come quite destitute of allies, after my long weary wanderings, with the small strength of my surviving friends. We should never get the better of Pelasgian Argos by fighting; if we should prevail by soothing speeches, we will come to some hope there. For how can you win a great cause by small For when the people fall into a vigorous fury, they are as hard to quench as a raging fire; but if you gently slacken your hold and yield a little to their tension, cautiously watching your opportunity, they may possibly calm down; if their gusts abate, you may obtain whatever you want from them easily. They have pity, and a hot temper too, an invaluable quality if you watch it closely. So for you I will go and try to persuade Tyndareus and the city to moderation. A ship also dips if its sheet is hauled too taut, but rights itself again if it is let go. The god hates excessive eagerness, and the citizens do also; I must save you, I don’t deny it, by cleverness, not by violence against those who are stronger. I could not do it by strength, as you perhaps imagine; for it is not easy to triumph single-handed over the troubles that beset you. I would never have tried to bring the but it is necessary. O you that have no use, except to lead an army in a woman’s cause! O worst of men in your friends’ defense, do you turn your back on me and flee, the deeds of Agamemnon lost and gone? After all, father, you had no friends in adversity. Alas! I am betrayed; no longer do I have any hope of finding a refuge where I may escape the death-sentence of But I see Pylades, the best of friends, coming at a run from Phocis—a pleasant sight! A man who can be trusted in troubles is a better sight than a calm to sailors. I have come through the city quickly, as I should, having heard and myself clearly seen the citizens assembling, against you and your sister, to kill you at once. What is happening? How is it with you? How are you doing, my best of comrades, friends and kin? For you are all these to me. I am ruined, to make plain to you my troubles in brief. You must destroy me also; for friends have all in common. Menelaus is the worst of men to me and my sister. It is natural for the husband of an evil woman to become evil. He no more repaid me by coming here, than if he had never come. Oh, has he really arrived in this land? He took a long time, but he was very soon detected as evil to his friends. And did he bring his wife, the worst of women, with him on his ship? It was not he who brought her here, but she who brought him. Where is she, the one woman who proved the ruin of so many Achaeans? In my house; if, that is, I ought to call it mine. And what did you say to your father’s brother? Not to see me and my sister killed by the citizens. By the gods! What did he say to that? I would like know this. He was cautious, the usual policy of ignoble friends. What excuse did he advance? When I have learned that, I know everything. There was a new arrival, the father who begot those noble daughters. You mean Tyndareus; he was angry with you, perhaps, for his daughter’s sake? You understand. And Menelaus preferred the family relationship with him to that with my father. He did not have the courage to share your troubles, when he was here? No, for he was not born a warrior, though strong among women! Your case is desperate, it seems, and you must die. The citizens must give their vote about us on the murder. And what is that to decide? Tell me, for I am alarmed. Our life or death; a brief speech on a large subject. Leave the palace with your sister now and try to escape. Don’t you see? We are being watched by guards on every side. I saw that the streets of the city were secured with armed men. We are as closely beleaguered as a city by its foes. Ask me now of my state; for I too am ruined. By whom? This would be a further trouble to add to mine. Strophius, my father, in a fit of anger, has banished me from his house. Bringing against you a private charge, or one in which the citizens share? He says it is an unholy crime to have helped you slay your mother. Alas! It seems my troubles will cause you grief as well. I am not like Menelaus in character; this must be endured. Are you not afraid that I am not theirs to punish; I belong to A terrible thing is the mob, whenever it has villains to lead it. But with honest leaders its counsels are always honest. Very well; we must consult together. About what necessity? Suppose I go and tell the citizens— That your action was just? In avenging my father? I am afraid they would be glad to catch you. Well, am I to crouch in fear and die without a word? That is cowardly. How then should I act? Suppose you stay here, what means of safety do you have? I have none. And if you go, is there any hope of escaping your troubles? There might be, possibly. Then that is better than staying. Then I will go. At least you die in this way, you will die more honorably. You are right; in this way I escape cowardice. Better than by staying. After all, my action was just. Pray that this may be the only view they take. Some one or two might pity me— Yes, your noble birth is a great point. Resenting my father’s death. That is all quite clear. I must go, for to die ignobly is a coward’s part. Well said. Shall we tell my sister? God forbid! True, there might be tears. That would be a grave omen. Yes, silence is clearly better. And you will gain time. There is only one obstacle in my way. What fresh objection now? I am afraid the goddesses will prevent me by madness. But I will take care of you. It is annoying to have to touch a sick man. Not to me, when it is you. Beware of becoming a partner in my madness. Let that pass. You will not hesitate? No, for hesitation is a grave mischief among friends. On then, pilot of my course! A service I am glad to render. And guide me to my father’s tomb. For what purpose? That I may appeal to him to save me. Yes, that is the proper way. May I not see my mother’s grave! No; she was an enemy. But hasten, so that the vote of supporting those limbs, slow from sickness, on mine; for I will carry you through the town, thinking little of the mob and unashamed. For how shall I prove my friendship, if not by helping you in sore distress? Ah! the old saying again, For a man who fuses into your ways, though he is an outsider, is better for a man to possess as a friend than a whole host of relations. The great prosperity and the prowess, proudly boasted throughout went back again from good fortune for the Atreidae long ago, from an old misfortune to their house, when strife came to the sons of Tantalus over a golden ram, to end in most pitiable banqueting and the slaughter of high-born children; and this is why murder exchanges for murder, through blood, and does not leave the two Atreidae. What seemed good was not good, to cut a mother’s flesh with ruthless hand and show the sword stained black with blood to the sun’s bright beams; The wretched daughter of Tyndareus in terror of death screamed to him: What affliction on earth surpasses this? What calls for keener grief or pity, than to shed with your hand a mother’s blood? Oh! what a dreadful crime he committed, and now is raving mad, a prey to the Furies, whirling blood with racing eyes, the son of Agamemnon! O the wretch! when he saw a mother’s bosom over her robe of golden weave, and yet he made her his victim, in recompense for his father’s sufferings. Women, has my poor Orestes left the house, mastered by the heaven-sent madness? Not at all; he has gone to the Oh! Why did he do it? Who persuaded him? Pylades; but this messenger will no doubt soon tell us what happened to your brother there. Wretched, unhappy daughter of the general Agamemnon, my lady Electra, hear the sad tidings I bring you. Alas! we are ruined; your words show it; you have clearly come with tidings of woe. The Pelasgians have decided by vote that you, poor lady, and your brother are to die this day. Alas! my expectations are realized; I have long feared this, and have been wasting away in mourning for what was sure to happen. But what was the trial, what was said by the Argives, to condemn us and ratify our death? Tell me, old friend; must I die by stoning or the sword? For I share my brother’s misfortunes. I had just come from the country and was entering the gates, needing to learn what was decided about you and Orestes, for I was always well disposed to your father when he was alive, and it was your house that reared me, poor indeed, yet loyal in the service of friends. I saw a crowd going and taking their seats on the height, where they say Danaus first gathered his people for a meeting, making amends to Pylades and your brother approaching together, the one with his head down, weakened by sickness; the other sharing his friend’s sorrow like a brother, tending his illness with constant care. Now when the Argives were fully gathered, a herald rose and said: expressing high admiration for your father, but not praising your brother, urging his crooked sentiments in specious words, that it would establish laws as to parents that are not good;  and all the while he was darting lively glances at  the friends of Aegisthus. Such is that tribe; heralds always trip across to the lucky side; the one who has power in the city or a post in the government is their friend. After him lord Diomedes made a speech; he said they should not kill you and your brother, but keep clear of guilt by punishing you with exile. Some roared out that his words were good, but others disapproved. Next stood up a fellow, who cannot close his lips; one whose impudence is his strength; an confident in bluster and ignorant free speech, and plausible enough to involve them in some mischief sooner or later; but it was Tyndareus who kept suggesting arguments of this kind to him as he urged the death of both of you. Another then stood up and said the opposite; he was not handsome in appearance, but a brave man, rarely coming in contact with the town or the circle in the market-place; a farmer—and they are the only ones who preserve our land—but clever, and eager to grapple with the arguments, his character without a blemish, his walk in life beyond reproach. He said that they should crown Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, for showing his willingness to avenge a father by the murder of a wicked and godless woman who would prevent men from taking up arms and going on foreign service, if those who remain behind, corrupt and seduce wives left at home to keep house. To the better sort, at least, his word carried conviction. No one spoke after him. Then your brother came forward and said: gained his point by appealing to the mob. Poor Orestes scarcely persuaded them not to kill him by stoning, promising to die by his own hand, with you, on this day. Pylades, in tears, is now bringing him from the conclave; and his friends bear him company, with wailing and lamentation; so he comes, a bitter sight and piteous vision. Make ready the sword or prepare the noose for your neck, for you must leave the light; your noble birth availed you nothing, nor did Phoebus from his seat on the tripod at O Pelasgia, I take up the dirge, doing bloody outrage on my cheeks with white nail, and beating on my head; these are the portion of Persephone, fair young goddess of the nether world. Let the Cyclopian land break forth into wailing for the sorrows of our house, laying the steel upon the head to crop it close. This is the piteous, piteous strain that goes up for those who are about to die, once the battle-leaders of It has gone, it has gone, and is lost, all the race of Pelops, and the glory that crowned their happy home once; the envy of heaven seized them and that cruel murdering vote among the citizens. Oh, oh! you tribes of short-lived men, full of tears, full of suffering, see how fate runs counter to your hopes! All receive in turn their different troubles in length of time; and the whole of mortal life is uncertain. Oh! to reach that rock which hangs suspended midway between earth and heaven, that fragment from to Tantalus, my forefather, who begot the ancestors of my house. They saw infatuate ruin, the chase of winged steeds, when Pelops in four-horse chariot drove over the sea, hurling the body of murdered Myrtilus into the ocean swell, after his race near Geraestus’ strand, foam-flecked from the tossing sea. From this came a woeful curse upon my house, brought to birth among the sheep by the son of for Atreus, breeder of horses; from which Strife changed the course of the sun’s winged chariot, fitting the westward path of the sky towards the single horse of Dawn; and Zeus diverted the career of the seven Pleiads into a new track and exchanged . . . death for death: both the banquet to which Thyestes gave his name, and the treacherous love of Cretan Aerope, in her treacherous marriage; but the crowning woe has come on me and on my father by the bitter constraints of our house. Look, here comes your brother, condemned to die, and with him Pylades, most loyal of friends, true as a brother, guiding his feeble steps, his yoke-fellow, pacing carefully. Alas! I weep to see you stand before the tomb, my brother, face to face with the funeral pyre. Alas, again! as I take my last look at you, my senses leave me. Be silent! an end to womanish lamenting! resign yourself to your fate. It is piteous, but nevertheless How can I be silent, when we poor sufferers are no longer to gaze upon the sun-god’s light? Oh! spare me that death! Enough that this unhappy wretch is already slain by Argives; let our present sufferings be. Alas for your unhappy youth, Orestes, and for your fated untimely death! When you should have lived, you are going to die. By the gods, do not unman me, bringing me to tears by the recollection of my sorrows. We are about to die; it is not possible for me not to grieve over our troubles; it is a piteous thing for all men to lose life, that is so sweet. This is the day appointed for us; we must fit the dangling noose about our necks or whet the sword for use. You be the one to kill me, brother, so that no Enough that I have a mother’s blood upon me; I will not kill you, but die by your own hand, however you wish. Agreed; I will not be behind you in using the sword; only I long to throw my arms about your neck. Enjoy that empty satisfaction, if embraces have any joy for those who have come so near to death. My dearest, you who have a name that sounds most loved and sweet to your sister, partner in one soul with her! Oh, you will melt my heart! I want to give you back a fond embrace. And why should such a wretch as I still feel any shame? In place of children and the marriage bed Ah! If only the same sword, if it is right, could kill us both, and one coffin of cedar-wood receive us! That would be very sweet; but surely you see we are too destitute of friends to be allowed one tomb between us. Did that coward Menelaus, that traitor to my father, not even speak for you, or make an effort to save your life? He did not even show himself, but, with his hopes centered on the throne, he was careful not to attempt the rescue of his friends. But let us see how we may die a noble death, one most worthy of Agamemnon. I, for my part, will let the city see my noble spirit when I plunge the sword to my heart, and you in turn must imitate my daring. Pylades, be the arbitrator of our slaughter and, when we both are dead, lay out our bodies decently; carry them to our father’s grave and bury us there with him. Farewell, now; I am leaving for the deed, as you see. Stop! there is first one point I have to blame you for, if you thought I would care to live when you are dead. But why are you called on to die with me? Do you ask? What is life to me without your companionship? You did not kill your mother, as I did to my sorrow. At least I helped you; and so I ought to suffer the same penalty. Surrender to your father, do not die with me. You still have a city, while I no longer have, and your father’s home, and a great refuge of wealth. You have failed to marry my poor sister, whom I betrothed to you from a deep regard for your companionship; but find another bride and rear a family; for the marriage-tie which bound us is no more. Farewell, be happy, my beloved friend; we cannot, but you may; for we, the dead, are robbed of happiness. How far you are from grasping what I mean! May the fruitful earth, the radiant sky refuse to hold my blood, if ever I turn traitor and desert you when I have freed myself. For I shared in the murder, which I will not deny, and also schemed the whole plot, for which you are now paying the penalty; and so I ought to die together with you and her. For I consider her, whom you betrothed to me, as my wife. Whatever shall I say, when I reach if I was your friend before your misfortunes, but ceased to be your friend, when you were unfortunate? That must not be; no, this concerns me, too. But since we are to die, let us take counsel together that Menelaus may share our misfortune. Best of friends! if only I could see this before I die. Listen to me, and delay the stroke of the sword. I will, if I may take vengeance on my enemy. Hush now! I have small confidence in women. Have no fear of these; for they are our friends who are here. Let us kill Helen, a bitter grief to Menelaus. How? I am ready, if there is any chance of success. With our swords; she is hiding in your house. Indeed she is;  and already she is putting her seal on everything. No longer, after she is married to Hades. But how? She has her barbarian attendants. Barbarians indeed! I am not the man to fear any Phrygian. They are only fit to look after mirrors and perfumes! Has she brought Trojan luxury with her here? So much so, that The race of slaves is nothing to those who are free. Well, if I can do this deed, I do not shrink from dying twice over. No, nor I either, if it is you I am avenging. Explain the matter, and continue describing your plan. We will enter the house on the pretence of going to our death. So far I follow you, but not beyond. We will lament our sufferings to her. So that she will shed tears, although her heart is glad. And our condition will be like hers. How shall we proceed next in our contest? We shall have swords concealed in our cloaks. Will we dispose of her attendants first? We will shut them up in different parts of the house. And whoever refuses to be quiet, we must kill. And then the deed itself shows us where we must exert ourselves. To kill Helen; I understand that watchword. You have it; now hear how sound my scheme is. If we drew the sword upon a woman of greater chastity, the murder would be infamous; but, as it is, she will be punished for the sake of all whose fathers she slew, whose children she destroyed, and made widows out of brides. There will be shouts of joy, and they will kindle the altars of the gods, invoking on our heads many blessings, because we shed a wicked woman’s blood. After killing her, you will not be called and your mother—but I pass that by, for it is not seemly to mention it—and for him to possess your home, though it was by Agamemnon’s prowess that he recovered his bride. May I die, if we do not draw our swords upon her! But if we do not accomplish Helen’s death, we will set fire to the house and die. For we will not fail to achieve one distinction, an honorable death or an honorable escape. The daughter of Tyndareus, who has brought shame on her sex, has justly earned the hatred of every woman. Ah! there is nothing better than a trusty friend, neither wealth nor monarchy; a crowd of people is of no account in exchange for a noble friend. You were the one who devised the vengeance against Aegisthus, and stood by me in danger, and now again you are offering me a means to punish my foes and do not stand aside—but I will cease praising you, for there is something wearisome even in being praised to excess. Now since in any case I must breathe my last, I want to do something to my enemies before my death, so that I may requite with ruin those who betrayed me, and so that those who made me suffer may grieve. Yes! I am the son of Agamemnon, who was considered worthy to rule by submitting to die like a slave; my last breath shall be free and I will take vengeance on Menelaus. For if we could secure one object, we would be lucky, if a means of safety should unexpectedly come our way from somewhere, and we should be the slayers, not the slain; this is what I pray for. This wish of mine is a pleasant dream to cheer the heart, without cost, by means of the mouth’s winged words. I think I have it, brother, a means of safety for you, and for him and thirdly for myself. You mean divine providence. But why do I say that? Since I know the natural shrewdness of your heart. Listen to me now; and you Speak; the prospect of good news holds a certain pleasure. You know Helen’s daughter? Of course you do. I know her, Hermione, whom my mother reared. She has gone to Clytemnestra’s tomb. To do what? What hope are you hinting at? She was going to pour a libation over the tomb of our mother. Well, how does what you have said lead to our safety? Seize her as a hostage on her way back. What good can your suggested remedy do us three friends? If, after Helen’s slaughter, Menelaus tries to do anything to you or to Pylades and me—for this bond of friendship is wholly one—say that you will kill Hermione; you must draw your sword and hold it to the maiden’s throat. If Menelaus, when he sees Helen fallen in her blood, tries to save you to insure the girl’s life, allow him to take his daughter to his arms; but if he makes no effort to curb the angry outburst and leaves you to die, then cut the maiden’s throat. And I think if he puts in a mighty appearance at first, he will calm down in time; for he is not bold or brave by nature. That is my line of defense for our safety. My speech is over. O you that have the spirit of a man, though your body shows you to be a woman, how far more worthy you are to live than to die! Pylades, you will lose such a woman to your sorrow, or if you live, you will have a blessed marriage. Then may it be so, and may she come to the city of with all the honors of a happy wedding. How soon will Hermione return to the palace? All the rest was very well said, if we succeed in catching this impious father’s cub. Well, I expect she is near the house already, for the length of time agrees exactly. Good; you, Electra, my sister, stay before the palace and await the maiden’s approach; keep watch in case any one, whether an ally or my father’s brother, forestalls us by his entry before the murder is complete; and then make a signal to the house, either by beating on a panel of the door or calling to us within. Let us enter now and arm ourselves with swords for the final struggle, O father, in your home of gloomy night, your son Orestes calls you to come to the rescue of the destitute. It is on your account I am wrongfully suffering, and it is by your brother that I have been betrayed for doing right; it is his wife I wish to take and kill; you be our accomplice for this deed. Oh father, come! if within the ground you hear the cry of your children, who are dying for your sake. O kinsman of my father, Agamemnon, hear my prayers also; save your children. I killed my mother— I held the sword— I . . .  set them free from fear— To aid you, father. Nor did I betray you. Will you not hear these reproaches and rescue your children? With tears I pour you a libation. And I with laments. Cease, and let us set about our business. If prayers really do pierce the ground, he hears. O Zeus, god of my fathers, and holy Justice, give success to him and me and her; for there is one struggle for three friends, and one penalty, for all to live or—pay death’s account. My dear friends of What are you saying to us, mistress? For this honored name is still left for you in the Danaid town. Station yourselves, some here along the high road, others there on some other path, to watch the house. But why do you call me to this service? Tell me, my dear. I am afraid that some one, who is stationed at the house for slaughter, may find trouble upon trouble. Let us make haste and go on; I will keep careful watch upon this road towards the east. And I on this one, that leads westward. Throw a glance sideways. Here and there, then we are looking back again, as you tell us. Cast your eyes around, let them see everything, through your tresses. Who is that on the road? Who is this country-man wandering round your house? Ah! friends, we are ruined; he will at once reveal to our enemies the armed ambush.   All goes well here; look to your own watch, for no Danaid is approaching us. Your report agrees with mine; there is no noise here either. Well then, I will listen in the gateway.  now that all is quiet? They do not hear; alas for my troubles! Can it be that her beauty has blunted their swords? Soon some to her rescue, will attack the palace. Keep a better look-out; it is not a contest of sitting still; turn about, some here, some there. I am looking everywhere in turn along the road. Oh, Pelasgian Argos! I am being foully murdered. Did you hear? The men have put their hand to the slaughter. It is Helen screaming, at a guess. O eternal might of Zeus, of Zeus, only come to help my friends! Menelaus, I am dying, but you do not help me, though you are near. Slay her, kill her, destroy her! Stab with your twin double-edged swords the woman who left her father, left her husband, and killed so many of the men of all round the eddies of Scamander. Hush! hush! I caught the sound of a foot-fall on the road near the house. My dearest friends, it is Hermione advancing into the middle of the bloodshed; let our clamor cease. For she comes headlong into the meshes of the net. The prey will be good, if it is caught. Take up your places again with looks composed and faces not betraying what has happened; I too will have a gloomy look, as if I knew nothing of what has been done. Yes, I have returned after securing her favor; but I was filled with some alarm about a cry I heard from the palace as I was still at a distance. But why? Our present lot gives cause for groans. Oh, don’t say so! What is your news? Oh no! not my own relatives! It is decreed; we have put on the yoke of necessity. Was this the reason of the cry within? Yes, a suppliant cried out as he fell at Helen’s knees— Who is he? I know nothing more, if you do not tell me. Unhappy Orestes, entreating mercy for himself and me. The house then has good reason to shout. What else would make someone entreat more earnestly? But come and throw yourself before your mother in her prosperity, join your friends’ supplication that Menelaus may not see us die. O you that were nursed in my mother’s arms, have pity on us and relieve our pain. Come here to the struggle, and I myself will be your guide; for you alone  have power over our safety. See, I am hastening to the house; as far it as rests with me, regard yourselves as safe. Now, friends in the house with swords, seize the prey! Oh no! Who are these I see?  Hold her, hold her! Point a sword at her throat, then wait in silence, that Menelaus may learn that he has found men, not Phrygian cowards, and he has been treated as cowards deserve. Oh, oh, friends! raise a din, a din and shouting before the house, that the murder when done may not inspire the Argives with wild alarm, to make them bring aid to the palace, before I see for certain that Helen’s corpse lies bloody in the house, or hear the news from one of her attendants; for I know a part of the tragedy, of the rest I am not sure. In justice, retribution from the gods has come to Helen; for she filled all who drew  in my Asian slippers, by clambering over the cedar-beams that roof the porch and the Doric triglyphs, away, away! O Earth, Earth! in barbaric flight! Alas! You foreign women, where can I escape, flying through the clear sky or over the sea, which bull-headed Ocean rolls about as he circles the world in his embrace? What is it, Helen’s slave, creature from Ida?  with barbarian cry; destroyed through her beauty, born from a bird, swan-feathered, Leda’s cub, hellish Helen! to be a curse to Apollo’s tower of polished stone. Ah! Alas! woe to Dardania, its wailing, wailing, for the horsemanship of Ganymede, bedfellow of Zeus. Tell us clearly each event within the house. Ah, for Linus! Ah, for Linus! That is what barbarians say, alas, in their eastern tongue as a prelude to death, whenever royal blood is spilled upon the ground by deadly iron blades. To tell you everything in turn, they came into the house, two twin lions of but true to his friends, bold for the fight, clever in war and a deadly serpent. Curse him for his quiet plotting, the villain! In they came to the throne of the wife of faces wet with tears, and took their seats in all humility, one on this side, one on that, each with weapons. They threw, they threw their suppliant arms round the knees of Helen. Her Phrygian servants sprang up frantic, frantic; they called to each other in terror that there was treachery. To some there seemed no cause, but others thought that the viper who killed his mother was entangling the daughter of Tyndareus in the snare of his plot. And where were you? fled long before in terror? It happened that I, in Phrygian style, Phrygian, was wafting the breeze, the breeze by the curls of Helen, Helen, with a round feathered fan, before her face, in barbarian style; and she was twisting flax on her distaff with her fingers, and letting her yarn fall on the floor, for she wanted to sew with her flax purple cloth as adornment for the tomb from the Trojan spoils, a gift to Clytemnestra. Orestes said to the Spartan girl: no prophet of the future. But his accomplice, the Phocian villain, was off on other business: one here, one there, disposing of them What happened next? Mother of Ida, great, great mother! Oh! the murderous scenes and lawless wickedness that I saw, I saw, in the palace! They drew forth swords from hiding under their purple-bordered cloaks, each darting his eye a different way, lest anyone should be near. Like boar of the hills, they stood opposite the woman and said: She screamed, oh, oh! she screamed, and brought down her white arm upon her breast and beat her poor head; then turned her golden-sandalled steps in flight, in flight; but Orestes got before her in his Mycenean boots and clutched his fingers in her hair, and, bending back her neck on to her left shoulder, was on the point of driving the black sword into her throat. Where were you Phrygians in the house to help her? With a loud cry from the house we battered down with bars the doors and doorposts where we had been, and ran to her assistance from every direction, one with stones, another with javelins, a third with a drawn sword; but Pylades came to meet us, undaunted, like Hector of how much less we were in battle strength to the Hellene might. There was one man gone in flight, another slain, another wounded, yet another pleading to stave off death; but we escaped under cover of the darkness; while some were falling, some were about to fall, and others were lying dead. And just as her unhappy mother sank to the ground to die, the luckless Hermione came in. Those two, like Bacchantes when they drop the thyrsus for a mountain cub, rushed and seized her; then turned again to the daughter of Zeus to slay her; but she had vanished from the room, passing right through the house, O Zeus and Earth and light and night! whether by magic spells or wizards’ arts or heavenly theft. What happened afterwards I do not know; for I stole out of the palace, a runaway. So Menelaus endured his painful, painful suffering to recover his wife Helen from And look, here is a strange sight succeeding others; for I see Orestes sword in hand before the palace, advancing with excited steps. Where is the one who fled from the palace to escape my sword? Before you I prostrate myself, lord, and supplicate you in my foreign way. We are not in Everywhere, the wise find life sweeter than death. I suppose that shouting of yours was not for Menelaus to come to the rescue? Oh no! it was to help you I called out, for you are more deserving. Did the daughter of Tyndareus die justly, then? Most justly, even if she had three throats to die with. Your cowardice makes you glib; this is not what you really think. Why, surely she deserved it, the one who destroyed Swear you are not saying this to humor me, or I will kill you. I swear by my life, an oath I would keep! Did every Phrygian in Take your sword away! Held so near it flashes a dreadful gleam of blood. Are you afraid of being turned to a stone, as if you had seen a Gorgon? To a stone, no! but to a corpse; I don’t know this Gorgon’s head. A slave, and yet you fear death, which will release you from trouble? Slave or free, every one is glad to gaze upon the light. Well said! Your shrewdness saves you; go inside. You will not kill me after all? You are spared. How well you said that! Now it’s time to change my plans. You didn’t say that well! You fool! Do you think I could endure to make your throat bloody? You weren’t born a woman, nor do you belong among men. The reason I left the palace was to stop your shouting; for my sister, and Pylades, my fellow conspirator, he will have two corpses to behold, his daughter’s as well as his wife’s. Ah, fortune! Again and yet again the house comes to a fearful contest, for the race of Atreus. What are we to do? Carry tidings to the town? Or hold our peace? It is safer, friends. Look, look at that sudden rush of smoke to the sky in front of the palace, telling its tale! They are kindling torches to fire the halls of Tantalus; nor do they hold back from murder. A god determines the end where he wishes, for mortals. Great is the power; by avenging fiends, this house has fallen, fallen, through blood, by reason of the hurling Myrtilus from the chariot. But look! I see Menelaus approaching the palace in haste; no doubt he has heard what is happening here. Descendants of Atreus within, make haste and secure the doors with bars. A man in luck is a dangerous adversary for luckless wretches like you, Orestes. I have come at the report of strange and violent deeds perpetrated by a pair of lions, men I do not call them. What I heard was that my wife was not dead, but had vanished out of sight, an idle rumor which someone fooled by his own fear brought me. But that is a plot of the matricide’s—ridiculous! Open the doors! I tell my servants to force the gates, so that I may rescue my child at any rate from the hands of those blood-stained men and recover my poor wretched wife, while the ones who destroyed her must die at my hands. You there! Keep your hands off those bolts; I mean you, Menelaus, towering in your audacity! Or I will tear off the ancient parapet, the work of masons, and shatter your skull with this coping-stone. The doors are bolted and barred, which will prevent your eagerness to bring aid and keep you from entering. Oh! What is this? I see a blaze of torches and men standing at bay on the top of the house, with a sword guarding my daughter’s throat. Would you question me or hear me speak? Neither; but I suppose I must hear you. I intend to kill your daughter, if you want to know. After slaying Helen, you will add murder to murder? Would I had accomplished that, instead of being duped by the gods! Do you deny having slain her, and say this out of wanton insult? Yes, I do deny it, to my sorrow. If only I had— Done what? You frighten me! Hurled the pollution of Give back my wife’s dead body, so that I may bury her. Ask the gods for her; but I will kill your daughter. This matricide is adding murder to murder. This champion of his father, betrayed by you to death. Are you not content with the present stain of your mother’s blood? I would not grow tired if I had these wicked women to slay for ever. Are you too, Pylades, a partner in this bloody work? His silence says he is; let it suffice for me to say it. You’ll say it to your cost, unless you fly away! We will not try to escape; we will set fire to the palace. What! will you destroy the home of your ancestors? Yes, so that you don’t have it, and I will offer this girl in sacrifice on the fire. Kill her; and if you do, I will punish you for it. All right, then. No, no! Don’t do it! Silence! Your sufferings are just; endure them. Well, is it just that you should live? And rule a kingdom, yes. A kingdom, where? Here in Pelasgian Argos. You are so well qualified to handle holy water! And why not? And to slay victims before battle! Well, are you? Yes, my hands are clean. But not your heart. Who would speak to you? The one who loves his father. And the one who honors his mother? He was born fortunate. Not like you! No, for I do not delight in these wicked women. Remove that sword from my daughter! You are a liar. Will you kill my daughter? Now you are not a liar! Ah me! what shall I do? Go to the Argives and persuade them— Persuade them what? Not to kill us; entreat the city. Or you will slay my child? That is correct. O wretched Helen— Am I not wretched? I brought you back from If only she had been! After innumerable troubles. Except where I was concerned. I have suffered dreadfully! Yes, for you would not help me then. You have me there. Your own cowardice has you. kindle the parapet of these walls. O Danaid earth! Dwellers in  failed to destroy, when you were seeking to anger Menelaus, for she, his child, must be immortal, and take her seat with Castor and Polydeuces in the enfolding air, a savior to mariners. Choose another bride and take her to your home; for the gods by that one’s loveliness joined So much for Helen; as for you, Orestes, you must cross the broders of this land and dwell for one whole year on Parrhasian soil, which from your flight shall be called the land of Orestes by Azanians and Arcadians. And when you return from there to the city of the gods will be arbitrators of your trial, and will take a most righteous vote on you at the hill of Ares, where you are to win your case. And it is destined, Orestes, that you will marry Hermione, at whose neck you are holding your sword; Neoptolemus shall never marry her, though he thinks he will; for he is fated to die by a Delphian sword, when he claims satisfaction of me for the death of his father Achilles. Give your sister in marriage to Pylades, to whom you formerly promised her; the life awaiting him is one of happiness. Menelaus, leave Orestes to rule for I forced him to murder his mother. Hail, prophetic Loxias, for your oracles! You were not a lying prophet after all, but a true seer; and yet I was afraid that it was some fiend I had listened to, when I seemed to hear your voice; but all is ending well, and I obey your word. There! I release Hermione from slaughter and agree to make her my wife whenever her father gives her. All hail, Helen, daughter of Zeus! I wish you joy of your home in heaven’s happy courts. To you, Orestes, I betroth my daughter, as Phoebus said; being noble yourself, may you have benefit from a noble wife, and may I also, in giving her to you. Go now each one to the place appointed by me; reconcile your quarrels. I must obey. And so must I; I make a truce with my fate, Menelaus, and with your oracles, Loxias. Go your ways, and honor Peace, fairest of goddesses; I will bring Helen to the halls of Zeus, when I have come to the sky, bright with stars. There, enthroned beside Hera and Hebe, the bride of Heracles, she will be honored by men with libations as a goddess for ever; along with those Zeus-born sons of Tyndareus, she will be a guardian of the sea, for the good of sailors. Greatly revered Victory, may you occupy my life, and never cease to crown me!  \n",

                             Here we are, the faithful Council of the Persians, who have gone to the land of we whom Xerxes, our King, Darius’ royal son, himself selected, by virtue of our rank and years, to be the guardians of his realm. the soul within my breast is distressed and presages disaster.  For the whole populace of the Asian nation has come and murmurs against its youthful King, nor does any courier or horseman arrive at the city of the Persians, who left behind them the walled defence of presenting a dense array of war. they press on, commanders of an enormous host, skilled in archery and horsemanship, formidable to look upon and fearful in battle through the valiant resolve of their souls.  Artembares, too, who fights from his chariot, and Masistres, and noble Imaeus, skilled with the bow, and Pharandaces, and Sosthanes, who urges on his steeds.  Others in addition the mighty, fecund Pegastagon of Egyptian lineage, mighty Arsames, lord of sacred well-skilled and countless in number. Behind them follows a throng of luxurious Lydians and those and to cast the yoke of slavery upon Hellas—Mardon, Tharybis, anvils of the lance, and the Mysians, hurlers of the javelin. and those who rely on their skill in archery.  The nation too which wears the sabre follows from every part of who have departed, and in fierce longing for them the whole land of The royal army, dealing destruction to cities, has already passed to the neighboring land upon the facing shore,  and this they did by crossing the named for the daughter of Athamas, on a bridge of boats made fast with cables, thereby casting a tightly constructed roadway as a yoke upon the neck of the sea. The fiery lord of populous is leading his wondrous warrior-flock against the whole earth in two divisions, on foot and by the sea, putting his trust in his stalwart and stern commanders; he himself, a god-like hero whose race is sprung from gold. With eyes flashing with the dark glare of a deadly dragon, attended by soldiers and mariners in great numbers, and speeding his Syrian chariot, he leads against a people renowned for the spear a warlike host of archers. And there is no man skilled to withstand the mighty stream of men, and with strong barriers keep out the sea’s invincible surge; for For by the will of the gods Fate has held sway since ancient time, and has ordained for the Persians the pursuit of rampart-destroying war, the turmoil of fighting horsemen, and the  storming of cities. And they have learned to look upon the precinct of the deep when the broad-wayed sea whitens to foam beneath the tempest’s blast, trusting in their finely wrought cables and their devices which give passage to their army. Yet the insidious guile of god—what mortal man can escape it?  Who with agile foot can lightly  overleap and escape its toils? For Delusion, with her fair appearance, lures men astray into her snares, from which it is not possible to escape without meeting with disaster. Therefore  my heart is wrapped in gloom and is racked with fear for the Persian army lest the state  learn that the mighty capital of Fearful I am too that as bands of women cry aloud and that there will be a tearing  of fine linen robes. For all the men-at-arms, those who urge on steeds and those who march along the plain, have left the city and gone forth, like bees in a swarm, together with the captain of the host. They have crossed the headland, projecting into the sea and common to either continent, through which both shores are bridged. And marriage-beds are filled with tears through longing for husbands; each Persian woman has sent to the field her warlike and fiery consort, and now in grief and longing for her beloved lord, is left forsaken by her mate. But come, Persians, let us take our place on the steps of this ancient palace and devise some wise and deeply-pondered counsel—for need of this has come upon us—as to how Xerxes our King, Darius’ son, scion of our own race as his forefather’s name declares, is faring.  Is it the drawing of the bow that has triumphed, or is it the might of the sharp spear-head  which has prevailed? But look, here is a light like the eyes of the god, the mother of our king, my Queen.  I bow low before her.  It is fitting also that we all address her with words of salutation. O Queen, most exalted of For this very reason I have left the gold-decorated palace and the chamber which belongs to Darius and myself, and have come here.  My heart, too, is racked with anxiety, and to you, my friends, will I make a disclosure. For I am by no means free from apprehension that wealth, grown great, will, raising a cloud of dust upon the ground, trip up the prosperity which Darius raised not without the favor of some god. It is for this reason that there is a double concern in my mind: neither to hold in honor vast wealth without men, and that the light of success does not shine, in proportion to their strength, on men without riches.  Our wealth, at all events, is ample, but my anxiety is for the light, the salvation of the house, which I regard to be the presence of its lord. Therefore, since things stand as they do, lend me your counsel in this concern, Persians, my aged trusty servants.  For all my hopes of good counsel depend on you. Be assured, our country’s Queen, that you need not twice mention either word or deed regarding that in which it is possible for us to direct you. For we whom you summon as counsellors in these matters are well disposed towards you and your interests. I have been haunted by a multitude of dreams at night since the time when my son, having despatched his army, departed with intent to lay waste the land of the Ionians.  But never yet have I beheld so distinct a vision as that of the last night.  This I will describe to you. flawless in beauty, sisters of the same family. As for the lands in which they dwelt, to one had been assigned by lot the land of attempted to restrain and placate them. He yoked them both to his car and placed the collar-straps upon their necks.  The one bore herself proudly in these trappings and kept her mouth obedient to the rein.  The other struggled and with her hands tore apart the harness of the car; then, free of the curb,  she dragged it violently along with her and snapped the yoke in two.  My son was hurled to the ground and his father Darius stood by his side filled with pity.  But Xerxes, when he caught sight of him, tore the garments covering his body. Such was the vision I beheld in the night. But when I had risen and dipped my hands in the clear-flowing water of a spring, I drew near to an altar with incense in my hand, intending to make an offering of sacrificial cake to the divinities that avert evil, those to whom these rites are due. But I saw an eagle fleeing for safety to the altar of Phoebus—and out of terror, my friends, I stood speechless. Thereupon I caught sight of a falcon rushing at full speed with outstretched wings and with his talons plucking at the head of the eagle, which did nothing but cower and yielded its body to his foe. Mother, we would neither alarm you unduly by our words nor raise your hopes too high.  If, however, it is something inauspicious that you have seen, visit the gods with supplication and entreat them to avert the evil and to bring to pass what will be beneficial to you, your children, the kingdom, and all else that you hold dear.  Next, it is appropriate that you should offer libations to Earth and the dead; and use auspicious words to address your husband Darius, whom you say you have seen in the night, and ask him to send into the light of day from beneath the earth blessings for you and your son; ask too that the reverse of this may be held in bondage beneath the earth and fade away in gloom.  Such is the advice I, relying on my instincts, offer you with kind intent. According to our interpretation of these portents, the issue will in all respects prove prosperous to you. You, its first interpreter, have indeed read the meaning of my dream with goodwill, at least, toward my son and house.  May the outcome then prove beneficial! When I return to the palace, I will perform for the gods and my dear ones beneath the earth all those rites which you recommend. Meanwhile, my friends, I would like to learn where Far from here, to the west where the last rays of our Lord the Sun set. Can it then really be that my son had the keen desire to make this city his prey? Yes, for then all Does their army have such a multitude of men? Yes, it is an army of such magnitude that it has caused great disaster for the Medes. And what else have they besides?  Do they have sufficient wealth in their homes? Of silver they possess a veritable fountain, a treasure chest in their soil. Is the bow-stretching arrow particularly suited to their hands? Far from it; they have lances for close fight and shields that serve them for armor. And who is set over them as shepherd and is master of their host? Of no man are they called the slaves or vassals. How then can they withstand the attack of an invading foe? So well as to have destroyed Darius’ great and courageous host. In truth, your words have given the fathers and mothers of those who are now on their way there dire food for thought. No, rather I think that you will soon learn the truth of the matter.  For here comes one who is beyond a doubt a Persian courier.  He bears clear tidings of some issue, be it good or bad. O cities of all the land of O realm of —the whole barbarian  host is lost. Grievous, grievous disaster, strange and cruel.  Alas, Persians, weep now that you hear of this calamity. Yes, weep, for you hear that the whole army is utterly destroyed; and I myself unexpectedly behold the day of my return. The life which has been given to us elders is too long, for we have now heard of this unexpected misery. Since I myself was present and did not merely hear what happened from the report of others, I can tell you exactly what kind of disaster was wrought. Alas, alas!  In vain did our vast and variously armed host go forth from the land of Full of the bodies of men who perished by a miserable fate are the shores of Alas, alas!  You say that the bodies of our loved ones, battered by the brine and drenched, are tossing, washed back and forth among the reefs. Our bows were of no use, and the whole host has perished, overwhelmed when ship charged on ship. Raise a doleful and mournful wail for the Persians, the wretched Persians, since they have met with complete and utter ruin.  Alas for the destruction of our host! O name of Alas, how I groan when I recall the memory of Ah, hateful indeed is Long have I kept silent in my misery, struck with dismay at our disaster; for this calamity is so great that it is not possible to say or even to ask about its extent. Nevertheless mortals must endure affliction when it is heaven-sent. Compose yourself, and even though you groan at our loss, relate the sum of our disaster and speak out! Who is there that is not dead?  Whom of our leaders must we bewail?  Who, appointed to wield command, by death left  his post empty, without its chief? Xerxes himself lives and beholds the light. The words you utter bring a great light of joy into my house, and bright day after night wrapped in gloom. But Artembares, commander of ten thousand cavalrymen, is being battered now against Silenia’s cruel shore. And Dadaces, leader of a thousand men, leapt, struck by a spear, with a nimble bound from his ship. Tenagon, the true-born Bactrians’ chieftain, is ranging now around the surf-beaten isle of Ajax.  Lilaeus and Arsames, and, third, Argestes, kept buffeting against its rugged shore, whirled around about the island, leader of the Black Cavalry, thirty thousand strong, in death dyed red his thick and shaggy beard, changing its color with a deep crimson stain. Arabus, too, the Magian, perished there, and Bactrian Artabes, a settler now in a rugged land. Amistris, and Amphistreus, wielder of a painful spear, and brave Ariomardus, whose death brought grief to lies dead in a state of misery, no longer attended by good fortune. Although our losses were many, I announce but few. Alas!  The words I hear put the very crown upon our woes; a disgrace to the Persians and cause for shrill lament.  But retrace your tale and tell me this clearly: how great was the number of the Greek ships which gave them confidence enough to go into battle with their armed prows against the Persian army? If numbers had been the only factor, be assured that the barbarians would have gained the victory with their fleet.  For the whole number of the ships of and, in addition to these, there was a chosen squadron of ten.  But Xerxes, this I know, had under his command a thousand, while those excelling in speed were twice a hundred, and seven more.  This is the total of their respective numbers.  Do you think that we were simply outnumbered in this contest? No, it was some divine power that tipped the scale of fortune with unequal weight and thus destroyed our host.  The gods preserve the city of the goddess Pallas. Is then the city of No, while her men still live, her ramparts are impregnable. But the beginning of the encounter of the fleets,  tell me about  it.  Who began the onset?  Was it the Hellenes?  Or my son, exulting in the multitude of his ships? My Queen, some destructive power or evil spirit, appearing from somewhere or other, caused the beginning of our utter rout. A Hellene, from the Athenian host, came to your son Xerxes and told this tale: that, when the gloom of black night should set in, the Hellenes would not remain in place, but, springing upon the rowing benches of their ships, would seek, some here, some there, to preserve their lives by stealthy flight.  But Xerxes, when he heard this, comprehending neither the cleverness of the Greek nor that the gods grudged him success, straightway gave all his captains orders to this effect—that, when the sun had ceased to illumine the earth with his beams, and darkness had covered the region of the sky, they should bring up in a tight group the main body of the fleet, disposed in triple line, to bar the exits and the sounding straits, and station other ships in a circle around the island of Ajax. He gave them a warning too that, should the Hellenes escape an evil doom, finding by stealth some means of flight for their fleet, it had been decreed that every captain should lose his head.  These commands he made with complete confidence of heart, since he knew not the issue intended by the gods.  Our crews then, with no lack of order but with an obedient spirit, prepared their evening meal, while each sailor looped his oar about its thole-pin so that it fitted well.  But when the light of the sun had faded and night drew on, each master of an oar and each man versed in arms went on board. The long galleys cheered each other, line by line; and they held their course as each captain had been ordered, and all through the night the commanders of the fleet kept their whole force cruising to and fro across the strait.  Night began to wane, yet the fleet of the Hellenes in no way attempted to put forth by stealth.  When, however, radiant Day with her white horses shone over all the land, a loud cheer like a song of triumph first rang out from the Hellenes, and, at the same instant, clear from the island crags, an echo returned an answering cry.  Terror fell on all the barbarians, balked of their purpose; for then the Hellenes chanted their solemn paean, not as in flight, but as men rushing to the onset with the courage of gallant hearts. Alas! In truth a vast sea of troubles has burst upon the Persians and the entire barbarian race. Be assured of this, not even half of the disaster has as yet been told.  A calamity so dreadful as to outweigh these ills twice over befell them. But what greater misfortune than this could have befallen them?  Speak! What is this other disaster you say came upon our force, sinking the scale to greater weight of ill? Those Persians who were in their life’s prime, bravest in spirit, pre-eminent for noble birth, and always among the foremost in loyalty to the King himself— these have fallen ignobly by a most inglorious doom. Ah, I am truly reduced to misery through this disaster!  By what fate was it that you say they met their end? There is an island There Xerxes dispatched these, his choicest troops, in order that when the Hellenic enemy, wrecked from their ships, should flee in search of safety to the island, they might slaughter their force, an easy prey, and rescue their comrades from the straits of the sea.  Grievously did he misjudge the issue.  For when some god had given the glory to the Hellenes in the battle on the sea, on that same day, fencing their bodies in armor of bronze, they leapt from their ships and encircled the whole island, so that our men were at a loss which way to turn.  Often they were struck by stones slung from their hands, and arrows sped from the bow-string kept falling upon them and doing them harm.  At last the Hellenes, charging with one shout, struck them and hacked to pieces the limbs of the poor wretches, until they had utterly quenched the life of all. Xerxes groaned aloud when he beheld the extent of the disaster, for he occupied a seat commanding a clear view of the entire army—a lofty headland by the open sea.  Tearing his robes and uttering a loud cry, he straightaway gave orders to his force on land and dismissed them in disorderly flight.  This, besides the one already told, is the disaster you must bewail. O hateful divinity, how have you foiled the purpose of the Persians!  Cruel was the vengeance which my son brought upon himself for his designs against illustrious whom Marathon destroyed were not enough.  It was in an effort to exact retribution for them that my son  has drawn upon himself so great a multitude of woes. But the ships that escaped destruction—tell me about them.  Where did you leave them?  Can you give a clear report? The commanders of the ships which still remained fled with a rush in disorder wherever the wind bore them.  As for the survivors of the army, they perished in Boeotian territory, some, faint from thirst, beside a refreshing spring, while some of us, exhausted and panting, made our way to the land of the Phocians, to Doris and the Melian gulf, where the Spercheus waters the plain with kindly stream.  Coming from there, badly in need of food, we received welcome in the Achaean land and the cities of the Thessalians. There it was that many perished of thirst and hunger, for we were oppressed by both.  And we came to the Magnesian land and to the country of the Macedonians, to the ford of the in the Edonian land.  But on that night the god roused winter before its time and froze the stream of sacred Strymon from shore to shore. Many a man who before that had held the gods in no esteem, implored them then in supplication, doing obeisance to earth and heaven. But when our host had made an end of its fervent invocation of the gods, it ventured to pass across the ice-bound stream.  And each of us who started on his way before the sun god dispersed his beams, found himself in safety, for the bright orb of the sun with its burning rays heated the middle section and pierced it with its flames.  One after another our men sank in, and fortunate indeed was he who perished soonest.  The survivors, after making their way through —and few they were indeed—escaped to the safety of the land of their homes; now the city of the Persians may make lament in regret for the beloved youth of the land.  What I say is true, yet much remains untold of the ills launched by Heaven upon the Persians. O unearthly power, source of our cruel distress, with what crushing weight have you fallen upon the whole Persian race! How the utter destruction of our host distresses me!  O vivid vision of my dreams at night, how clearly did you signify misfortune to me! And all too lightly did you in turn interpret it.  However, since your explanation determined thus, first of all I wish to offer prayers to the gods, and then I will return after I have brought from the palace a sacrificial cake as a gift to Earth and the dead. I know indeed that it is for what cannot be undone, yet I do this in the hope that something more auspicious may come to pass in the future.  But you should confer faithfully with the faithful counsellors in view of what has befallen.  And as for my son, if he should come here before I return, comfort him and escort him to the palace, so that he will not inflict on himself some further ill to crown those already ours. O sovereign Zeus, by destroying the army of the haughty and multitudinous Persians, you have shrouded in the gloom of grief the city of and moistens with drenching tears the robe covering her bosom.  And the Persian wives, indulging in soft wailing through longing to behold their lords and abandoning the daintily wrought coverlets of their couches, the delight of their youth, mourn with complainings that know no end. So I too sustain the truly woeful fate of those who are gone. For now in truth the whole land of Xerxes led forth (woe!), Xerxes laid low (woe!), Xerxes disposed all things imprudently with his sea-going vessels.  Why then was Darius in his time so unscathed by disaster, he who was ruler of archers, to the men of For infantry and seamen both, the ships, dark-eyed led forth (woe!), the ships laid them low (woe!), the ships, under the deadly impact of the foe and by the hands of Ionians. The King himself, as we learn, has barely made his escape over the wintry paths which traverse the plains of And they who were first to meet their doom (alas!), left behind  by dire necessity (alas!), are swept along the Cychrean strand (woe!).  Groan and gnash your teeth; in grievous strain shout forth our woes till they reach the heavens (alas!), raise high your wailing clamor in cries of misery. Lacerated by the swirling waters (alas!) they are gnawed (alas!) by the voiceless children of the undefiled sea (alas!).  The home, bereaved of his presence, laments its head; and parents, bereft of their children, in their old age bewail their heaven- sent woes (alas!), now that they learn the full measure of their afflictions. Not now for long will those who dwell throughout the length and breadth of abide under the sway of the Persians, nor will they pay further tribute at the compulsion of their lord, nor will they prostrate themselves to the earth and do him reverence; for the royal power has perished utterly. My friends, whoever has experience of misery knows that when a sea of troubles comes upon mortal men, they view all things with alarm; but when fortune flows with prosperous tide, they believe that this same fortune will forever bring them success.  Now in my case everything seems full of dread; before my eyes appears the enmity of the gods, and in my ears there rings a sound that has no note of joy; such is my consternation at the evil tidings which terrify my soul. offerings that soothe the dead, both white milk, pleasant to drink, from an unblemished cow, and bright honey, distillation wrought from blossoms by the bee, together with lustral water from a virgin spring; and from a rustic source, this unmixed draught, the quickening juice of an ancient vine.  Here too is the fragrant fruit of the pale-green olive that lives the entirety of its life in luxuriant foliage; and garlanded flowers, produce of the bounteous earth. chant solemn songs as I make these libations to the dead, and summon forth the divine spirit of Darius, while I convey, in honor of the gods, these offerings for the earth to drink. Royal lady, august queen of the Persians, pour these libations down to the chambers of the earth, while we,  in solemn chant, beseech the guides of the dead beneath the earth to be gracious to our prayers.\\n               O holy divinities of the nether world, Earth and Hermes, and you, Lord of the dead, send up to the light the spirit from below; for if, beyond our prayers, he knows any further remedy for our distress, he alone of mortals can declare how to bring it to accomplishment. Does our sainted and godlike king hear me as I utter, in obscure barbaric speech,  my dismal and dolorous cries?  Or must I shout aloud the utter misery of my anguish so that it pierces the earth?  Does he hear me from below? O Earth, and you other rulers of those who dwell in the nether world, ensure, I implore, that the glorious spirit, the god of the Persians, whom Send to the upper world him the likes of whom the Persian earth has never entombed. Beloved indeed was the hero, beloved is his burial mound; beloved are the qualities that lie buried there.  O Aidoneus, Aidoneus, who convey shades to the upper air, permit our divine lord Darius to come forth! For since he did not ever cause the destruction of his people by senseless and ruinous wars, he bore the name of divine counsellor to the Persians; and a divine counsellor he was, since he guided his people well. King, our king of old, come forth, draw near! Rise to the barrow’s topmost point, lift your saffron-dyed sandal, display the crest of your royal tiara! Come forth, O blameless father Darius. That you may hear pitiable and unheard-of sorrows, O Lord of our lord, appear!  For a gloom, like that of Styx, hovers over us, since all the youth of the land is now utterly destroyed.  Come forth, O  blameless father Darius! Alas, alas!  You whose death your friends bewailed with bitter tears, why, my king, my king, why is it that our land has lost all its three-tiered galleys, ships that are no more, no more? O most faithful of the faithful, comrades of my youth, aged Persians, what is it that is troubling the state?  The earth groans and is furrowed by the stamp of men.  As I behold my wife by my tomb, I feel alarm, and I accept her libations in kindly mood; while you, standing near my tomb, make lament, and with shrill cries that summon the spirits of the dead, invoke me piteously.  Not easy is the path out of the tomb, for this reason above all, that the gods beneath the earth are readier to seize than to release.  Nevertheless, since I have obtained dominion among them, I have come. But make haste, so that I may  not incur blame regarding the time of  my sojourn.  What is this unexpected ill that weighs the Persians down? I shrink in awe from gazing upon you. I shrink in awe from speaking in your presence by reason of my former dread of you. Since, in compliance with your moanings, I have come from the world below, lay aside your awe of me; make your tale not long, but brief; speak out and deliver your story in its entirety. I fear to do your bidding; I fear to speak in your presence and deliver to those I love news hard to utter. Since dread long ingrained in your mind restrains you, cease, noble woman, venerable partner of my bed, from your tears and laments, speak to me with all frankness.  Afflictions ordained for human life must, we know, befall mankind.  For many calamities from the sea, many from the land, arise to mortal men if their span of life is extended far. O you who in prosperity surpassed all mortal men by your happy destiny, since, so long as you gazed upon the beams of the sun, you lived a life of felicity, envied of all, in Persian eyes a god, so now too I consider you fortunate in that you died before you beheld the depth of our calamities.  The whole tale, O Darius, you will hear in brief space of time: the power of How did it happen?  Did some stroke of pestilence or factional strife come upon the State? Neither; but near Tell me, what son of mine led our army there? Impetuous Xerxes,  depopulating the whole surface of the continent. Was it by land or sea that he made this mad expedition, the reckless man? By both.  There was a twofold front of double armies. But how was it that so vast a land force won a passage to the farther shore? By a clever device he yoked the What!  Did he succeed in closing the mighty Yes indeed.   One of the divine powers must have assisted him in his purpose. Alas! Some mighty power came upon him so that he was not able to think clearly. Yes, since we can see the outcome, what ruin he wrought. And how then did they fare that you now lament them? Disaster to the naval force brought ruin to the force on land. And did the whole army utterly perish by the spear? Yes, and it is for this reason that the whole city of Alas for the loss of our warriors’ valiant force and defence! And the host of the Bactrians is lost, wholly destroyed: not even an old man is left. Unhappy man, since he has brought to ruin the youth of our allies. But Xerxes, alone and forlorn, with scanty train, they say— Met his end, how, tell me, and where?  Of his safety is there any hope? To his joy he reached the bridge yoking the two continents. And reached our continent in safety?  Is this certain? Yes, a proven report establishes this. Doubt there is none. Alas! The fulfilment of the oracles has indeed come swiftly, and it is my son upon whom Zeus has caused their issue to descend.  Yet I was confident that, only after long lapse of time, the gods would in some way bring them to accomplishment; nevertheless, when man hastens to his own undoing, the god too participates with him. A fountain of misfortune has now, I think, been discovered for all I love.  A son of mine it was who, in his ignorance, brought these things to pass through youthful recklessness; for he conceived the hope that he could by shackles, as if it were a slave, restrain the current of the sacred yes, even over Poseidon.  Must this not have been a disease of the soul that possessed my son?  I fear that the plenteous treasure amassed by my toil may become the prey of the spoiler. This lesson impetuous Xerxes learned through conversation with evil men.  For they kept telling him that, whereas you won plentiful treasure for your children by your spear, he, on his part, through lack of manly spirit, played the warrior at home and did not increase his father’s wealth. Hearing such taunts many a time from evil counsellors, he planned this expedition and army against Therefore a calamity dreadful and unforgettable has been caused by him, a desolating calamity such as never before befell this city of For Medus was first to be the leader of its host; and another, his son, completed his work since wisdom ruled his spirit.  Third, after him, Cyrus, blessed in good fortune, came to the throne and established peace for all his people. The Lydians and Phrygians he won to his rule, and the whole of and to the ancient throne; but he was slain in his palace by the guile of noble Artaphrenes, with the help of friends whose duty this was. and many a campaign I made with a valiant force; but disaster so dire as this I brought not upon the state.  Yet Xerxes my son, youth that he is, has the mind of youth and does not remember my injunctions.  Be sure of this, my age-mates: all of us who have held this sovereign power cannot be shown to have wrought ruin as great as this. What then, O king Darius?  What is the intention of your words? How, after this reverse, may we, the people of If you do not take the field against the Hellenes’ land, even if the forces of the Medes outnumber theirs.  The land itself is their ally. What do you mean?  In what way It wastes with famine an enemy force which is too large. But we will dispatch a force of select and easily managed troops. Not even the host which now remains in How is that?  Will not the whole barbarian army cross from Few indeed out of many, if it is right to put any faith in the oracles of Heaven, with regard to what has just been brought to pass; for they are fulfilled, not just some, while others fail.  And if this is truth, it is through persuasion of vain hopes that he is leaving behind a body of picked troops. They are now lingering where the plain is watered by the stream of Asopus which nourishes restrained by no religious awe, they ravaged the images of the gods and set fire to their temples.  Altars have been destroyed, statues of the gods have been thrown from their bases in utter ruin and confusion. Therefore, since they wrought such evil, evil they suffer in no less measure; and other evils are still in store: the spring of their woes is not yet quenched, but it still wells forth.  For so great will be the mass of clotted gore spilled by the Dorian lance upon Plataean soil that heaps of dead will reveal, even to the third generation, a voiceless record for the eyes of men that mortal man should not vaunt himself excessively.  For presumptuous pride, when it has matured, bears as its fruit a crop of calamity, from which it reaps an abundant harvest of tears. through disdain of present fortune and lust for more, squander his abundant wealth.  Zeus, in truth, is a chastiser of overweening pride and corrects with heavy hand.  Therefore, now that my son has been warned to be prudent by the voice of God, instruct him with admonitions of reason to cease  from drawing the punishment of Heaven on himself by his vaunting rashness.  And as for you, beloved and venerable mother of Xerxes, withdraw to the palace and bring from there clothing which is suitable for him, and prepare to meet your son.  For through grief at his misfortunes, the embroidered apparel which he was wearing has been torn into tattered shreds. Soothe him with words of kindness; for it is to your voice alone, I know, that he will listen.  As for me, I depart to the darkness beneath the earth. Farewell, Elders, and despite your troubles, rejoice while each day is yours; for wealth does not profit the dead at all. I grieve as I hear the many misfortunes that are now, and are yet to be, the lot of the barbarians. O God! How much grief assails me! But most of all this sorrow wounds me, to hear of the shameful clothes which are now worn by my son. But I will depart, and when I have brought appropriate garments from the palace, I will make attempt to meet my son; for I will not forsake him whom I love so well in his affliction. Oh yes, it was in truth a glorious and good life under civil government that we enjoyed so long as our aged and all-powerful king, who did no wrong and did not favor war, god-like Darius, ruled the realm. In the first place we showed to the world armies worthy of our fame, and civil institutions, like towers in strength, regulated all the state; and our return from war brought back our men, unworn and unsuffering, to happy homes. And what a number of cities he captured!— without crossing the stream of Halys or even stirring from his own hearth:  such as the Acheloan the Thracian settlements. And those outside the lake, the cities on the mainland, surrounded with a rampart, obeyed him as their king; those, too, that boast to be on both sides of the broad The sea-washed islands, also, off the projecting arm of the sea, lying close to this land of ours, such as and And he held under his sway the sea-girt islands midway between the continents,  whose mother-city is now the cause of our lament. And the rich and populous cities of the Hellenes in the Ionian heritage he controlled by his own will; and at his command he had an unwearied strength of men-at-arms and of allies from every nation.  But now, worsted completely in war through disasters on the sea, we endure this change of fortune no doubt from the hand of god. Alas, wretched am I who have met this cruel doom which did not give the faintest sign of its coming! In what savage mood has Fortune trampled upon the Persian race?  What misery is yet in store for me, unhappy wretch?  The strength of my limbs is loosened as I look upon this aged group of citizens. Ah, Zeus,I wish that the doom of death had buried me, too, together with the men who have been laid low! Alas, my king, for our noble army, for the high honor of and for the splendor of the men now cut off by Fate!\\n               The land bewails her native youth, slaughtered for Xerxes, who has crowded Hades with Persian slain. Many warriors, masters of the bow, our country’s pride, a great multitude of men, have perished.  Alas, alas, for our trusty defence!  The land of has piteously, yes piteously, been bowed to her knees. Behold me, alas, a fitting subject for lamentation, born a source of ruin to my race and fatherland. As a greeting for your return home I will lift up an ill-omened cry of woe, the voice, versed in lamentation, of a Mariandynian mourner, a wail attended by many a tear. Utter a strain of lamentation, plaintive and discordant.  For Fortune has now veered and turned against me. I will indeed utter the song of lamentation in commemoration of your sufferings and of our strongly-manned ships, buffeted by waves; the plaintive strain of our land which mourns its sons.  And I will cry aloud in lamentation, shedding many a tear. Yes, for the Ionian naval force, turning the tide of battle, swept them away, the Ionian host, ravaging the dark sea and the shore of doom. Woe!  woe!  cry aloud, learn about the whole disaster. Where is the rest of the multitude of your comrades?  Where are those who stood by your side, such as Pharandaces, Susas, Pelagon, Dotamas, and Agdabatas, Psammis, and Susiscanes of By the shores of I left them, fallen in death from a Tyrian ship. Woe!  woe!  cry aloud!  Where is your beloved Pharnuchus, and the courageous Ariomardus?  Where is prince Seualces, or Lilaeus of noble lineage, Woe, woe is me! They beheld ancient and hateful Did you really lose your trusty eye counted tens upon tens of thousands of the Persians, Batanochus’ son Alpistus . . . son of Sesames, Megabates’ son, Parthos and mighty Oebares, did you leave these behind? Alas, alas, the unhappy men!  You speak of woe, surpassing woe, for noble Persians. In truth you stir yearning in me for my gallant comrades when you tell me of woe, surpassing woe, hateful and unforgettable.  The heart within me cries out aloud for the wretched ones. And yet there are others too whom we miss:  Xanthis, commander of a myriad Mardian men, and warlike Anchares, Diaexis, too, and Arsaces, captains of the horse, Cegdadatas and Lythimnas, and Tolmus, insatiate in war.  I marvel, that they do not follow behind around your wheeled tent. Gone are they who were leaders of the host. Gone, alas, ingloriously. Alas, alas! Alas, alas, you powers divine, you brought ruin upon us,  unexpected, unmistakable to see, as is the glance of calamity. We have been stricken by misfortune such as will endure for ages. We have been stricken; it is abundantly clear. By strange woe, strange woe! It was with bad luck that we encountered How true it is. In the loss of so great an army I have indeed been dealt a blow, wretched as I am. What that belonged to Do you see this remnant of my royal robe? Yes, I do indeed. And this quiver— What is this you say has been saved? Treasury for shafts? Truly a small remnant from an ample store. We have been deprived of defenders.  They are a war-like people.  I have lived to behold a calamity I never expected. Are you speaking of the routed multitude which manned your ships? And I rent my robe at the disastrous event. Alas, alas! No, far worse than alas. Yes, for twofold and threefold— Pain to us, but exultation to our enemies Yes, and our strength has been maimed. I am stripped of my escort. By the disasters of your comrades upon the sea. Weep, weep over our calamity, and depart to your homes. Alas, alas, woe, woe! Cry aloud now in response to me. A wretched offering from the wretched to the wretched. Cry out, tuning your strain to mine. Oh, oh!  That which has happened is grievous indeed. Alas, for I too share in your sorrow. Strike, strike, and groan for my sake. I weep in lamentation! Now cry aloud in response to me. This care, my lord, is mine. Lift up your voice now in lamentation. Oh, oh!  And with our wailing, alas, will be mingled bruising blows and shrieks of pain. Beat your breast too, and raise the Mysian wail. Anguish, anguish! And tear, I beg of you, the white hair from your beard. With clenched nails, with clenched nails, with loud wailing. And utter shrill cries. This too I will do. And with your fingers tear the robe which drapes you. Anguish, anguish! Pluck out your locks, and lament our host. With clenched nails, with clenched nails, with loud wailing. Let tears moisten your eyes. I am drenched with tears. Cry aloud now in response to me. Alas, alas! With sounds of wailing go to your homes. Alas, alas! Alas! through the city. Alas, indeed! Pour forth your wails as you move along with soft steps. Alas, alas, O Persian land, grievous now to walk upon! Ah me! Those that perished in three-tiered galleys, ah me! I will escort you with dismal sounds of woe.  \n",

headland of sea-washed long ago the native of Malis, Poeas’ son, on the express command of the two chieftains to do so, because his foot was all running with a gnawing disease.  Neither libation nor burnt sacrifice could be attempted by us in peace, but with his wild, ill-omened cries he filled the whole camp continually with shrieking, moaning.  But what need is there to speak of that?  The time is not ripe for too many words, lest he even learn that I am here, and I so waste the whole ruse whereby I think soon to take him. Come, it is your task to serve as my ally in what remains, and to seek where in this region there is a cave with two mouths.  During cold weather it provides two seats facing the sun, while in summer a breeze wafts sleep through the tunnelled chamber. And a little below, on the left hand, perhaps, you will see water rising from a spring, if it has not failed.  Go there silently, and signal to me whether he still  dwells in this same place, or is to be found elsewhere, so that the rest of my plan may be explained by me, heard by you, and sped by the joint effort of us both. King Odysseus, the completion of the task that you set me is not far off, for I believe I see a cave like that which you have described. Above you, or below?  I do not see it. Here, high up—and of footfalls there is not a sound. See that he is not sheltered there asleep. I see an empty dwelling, without occupants. And is there no provision inside for human habitation? There is—a bed of leaves, as if for some one who makes his lodging here. And all else is bare?  There is nothing else beneath the roof? Just a cup of bare wood, the masterpiece of a sorry craftsman, and with it these tools for kindling. His is the store that you describe. Ha!  Yes, and here besides are some rags drying in the sun, stained by some severe infection. The man inhabits these regions, clearly, and is somewhere not far off.  How could he go far afield when his foot is maimed by that old plague?  No, he has gone out in quest of food, or of some soothing herb that he may have noted somewhere. Send your attendant, therefore, to keep watch, lest he come upon me unawares, since he would rather take me than all the Greeks together. The man is going, and the path will be watched.  And now, if you need anything else, say so. Son of Achilles, you must be loyal to the goals of your mission—and not with your body alone.  Should you hear some new plan unknown to you till now, you must serve it, since it is to serve that you are here. Then what are your orders? You must cheat the mind of Philoctetes by means of a story told as you converse with him.  When he asks you who and from where you are, say that you are the son of Achilles—it is not in that detail that you will cheat him.  But tell him you are sailing homeward, and have left the fleet of the Achaean warriors, after coming to hate them with unbounded hatred. Give him this reason:  when, with no other hope of taking will of me—even the vilest of vile insults.  You will not harm me at all by that.  But if you fail to do as I say, you will inflict pain on all the Argives, for if that man’s bow is not seized, you can never sack the realm of Dardanus. And learn why your intercourse with him may be free from mistrust and danger, while mine cannot.  You have sailed to perceives me while he is still master of his bow, I am dead, and you, as my comrade, will share my doom.  No, the thing for which we must devise a ruse is just this:  how you may steal his invincible weapons.  Well I know, my son, that by nature you are not apt to utter or contrive such treachery.  Yet knowing that victory is a sweet prize to gain, steel yourself to do it.  Our honesty shall be displayed another time.  Now, however, give yourself to me for one brief, shameless day, and then for the rest of time may you be called the most righteous of all humankind. I abhor acting on advice, son of But I am ready to take the man by force and without treachery, since with the use of one foot only, he will not overcome so many of us in a struggle.  And yet I was sent to assist you and am reluctant to be called traitor.  Still I prefer, my king, to fail when doing what is honorable than to be victorious in a dishonorable manner. Son of a father so noble, I, too, in my youth once had a slow tongue and an active hand.  But now that I have come forth to the test, I see that the tongue, not action, is what masters everything among men. What, then, are your orders—apart from my lying? I command you to take Philoctetes by deceit. And why by deceit rather than by persuasion? He will never listen;  and by force you cannot take him. Has he strength so terrific to make him bold? Yes, shafts inevitable, escorts of death. Then one does not dare even approach him? No, unless he takes the man by deceit, as I prescribe. Then you think it brings no shame to speak what is false? No, not if the falsehood yields deliverance. And with what expression on his face will anyone dare mouth those lies? When what you do promises gain, it is wrong to shrink back. And what gain is it for me that he should come to His arrows alone will capture Then I am not to be the conqueror, as you said? Neither will you be without them, nor they without you. It would seem, then, that we must track them down, if things stand as you say. Know that by doing this task, you win two rewards. What are they?  If I knew, I would not refuse the deed. You will be celebrated in the same breath as clever and as noble. So be it!  I will do it, and cast off all shame. Do you remember, then, the story that I recommended? Be sure of it, since once and for all I have consented. You stay here, then, to wait for him.  Meanwhile I will go away, so as not to be observed here with you, and I will send our lookout back to your ship.  And, if in my view you seem to linger at all beyond the due time, I will send that same man back again, after disguising him as the captain of a merchant-ship, so that secrecy may be on our side. Then, son, as he tells his artful story, take whatever in his tale is from time to time helpful to you.  Now I will go to the ship, leaving matters here to you.  May escorting Hermes the Deceiver, lead us on, and divine Victory, Athena Polias, who saves me always! I am a stranger in a strange land, Master.  What must I hide, what must I reveal to a man who will be swift to suspicion?  Show me the way!  His skill excels all other skill, his wisdom has no equal, whose hands govern the godlike scepter given by Zeus.  To you, my son, that sovereign power has descended from the dawn of time.  Therefore tell me how I must serve you. For the present—since perhaps you wish to see the place on the island’s edge where he resides—survey it without fear.  But when the dread traveler, who has left this dwelling, returns, step forward at my signal from time to time, and try to help as the moment may require. Long have I been careful of this care, my prince:  that my eyes should be watchful for your good above all else.  And now tell me, in what manner of shelter does he keep his dwelling?  In what region is he now?  It is not inopportune for me to learn so that he may not come upon me unawares from somewhere.  In what place does he wander, or rest?  Does he plant his steps within his shelter, or abroad? Well, here you see his home with its two portals, his rocky cell. And its wretched occupant, where is he gone to? It seems clear to me, anyway, that he is plowing his way along somewhere near here in search of food.  For I know of a report that this is his means of sustenance—a wretch wretchedly shooting prey with his feathered shafts—and that no one comes near to him to heal his misery. For my part, I pity him when I think how, with no one to care for him, and seeing no companion’s face, but suffering eternally alone, he is plagued by fierce disease and bewildered by each need as it arises. How, how does he endure his bitter fate?  Ah, contrivances of the gods!  Ah, unhappy tribes of mortals, whose life-portion exceeds due measure! That man—inferior in no way, probably, to any man belonging to the oldest families—lies alone without companions and stripped of all life’s gifts among the dappled or shaggy beasts.  He is a man to be pitied for his torments and his hunger alike, enduring anguish that has no cure.   But to his bitter cries the mountain nymph, babbling Echo, coming from afar, gives answer. No part of this is a marvel to me.  God-sent—if a man such as I may judge—are both those sufferings which attacked him from savage and those with which he now toils untended.  Surely he toils by the plan of some god so that he may not bend against by those arrows Hush,boy! What is it? I heard a sudden thud, one that might naturally come from a man worn by pain.  From there it came, I think—or there. It strikes, strikes hard on my ear, the sure sound of someone creeping along his way as if tortured.   I cannot miss that grievous cry of a man hard-pressed, even from afar—its tone is too clear. But listen, son— To what?  Tell me. To my latest thoughts.  For he is not far from his home, but nearby.  And not with music of the flute, like a shepherd pasturing his flocks, does he come,— no—but crying out a far-sounding howl as he stumbles, perhaps, from tortuous pain, or as he scans the haven unvisited by any ship.  His cries are loud, and terrible. O strangers! Who can you be, and from what country, that you have put into this harborless and desolate land?  What would I rightly say is your city or your ancestry?  The fashion of your equipment is Greek, and most welcome to my sight;  but it would please me to hear your voices.  And do not shrink from me in fear, or be frightened by my savage looks.  No, pity one so wretched and so lonely, a castaway, so friendless and so miserable.  Speak to me, if indeed you have come as friends. Oh, answer!  It is not right that I be disappointed by you in this request, at least, nor you by me. Well, know first, stranger, that we are Greeks, since you desire to learn this. O cherished sound!  Ah, that I should truly be greeted by such a man, after so long a time!  What need, young man, has made you land here and brought you to this spot?  What business?  What wind so kind?  Speak, tell me all, so that I may know who you are. My birthplace is the island Scyros, and I am sailing homeward.  I am the son of Achilles, by name Neoptolemus.  Now you know everything. O son of a father I loved, and of soil I cherished!  Ward of aged Lycomedes, on what mission have you touched this shore?  From where are you sailing? Well, since you ask, it is from What?  You were certainly not our shipmate at the beginning of the expedition there. And did you have a part in that toil? Then you do not know who I am? How should I know one whom I have never seen before? Then you have not even heard my name, or any rumor of those sufferings under which I have been perishing? Be sure that I know nothing of what you ask. How cursed I must be, how abhorred by the gods, if not a word of my miserable condition has reached my homeland, or any Greek land at all!  Instead those men, who against the gods’ laws cast me away, keep their secret and laugh, while my plague has ever flourished and grows worse! O my son, boy whose father was Achilles, here I am before you, the man of whom you have perhaps heard as lord of the bow of Heracles, Philoctetes the son of Poeas.  I am he whom the two marshalls and the Cephallenian king shamelessly hurled to this solitude which you see, when I was wasting with a fierce disease, stricken by the savage bite of the murderous serpent.  With that plague for my sole companion, boy, those men put me out here alone and left, after they landed here with their fleet from sea-washed a small work of charity.  But may they get what they gave me!  Can you imagine, boy, what kind of awakening I had when they had gone, and I rose from sleep that day?—what stinging tears I wept, and what miseries I bewailed when I saw that the ships with which I had sailed were all gone, and that there was no man in the place, not one to help me, not one to ease the sickness that afflicted me, when looking all around me, I could find nothing at hand, save agony—but of that a ready store? I believe that I, too, pity you, son of Poeas, as much as your former visitors. And I myself attest your accusations, for I know their truth through my own experience with the wickedness of the Atreids and the force of Odysseus. What, do you also have a grievance against the accursed sons of Atreus, a cause for anger at some mistreatment? If only I might one day be allowed to fulfill my heart’s rage by the deeds of my hand, so that Well said, son!  Now what is the reason that you have come complaining against them with this fierce wrath? I will tell you—and yet it is hard to tell— the outrage that I suffered from them upon my arrival there.  For when fate decreed that Achilles should die— Ah, me!  Tell me no more, until I first know this—is the son of Peleus dead? Dead—not by a mortal hand, but by a god’s. He was brought down, as men say, by the arrow of Phoebus. Well, noble alike are the slayer and the slain.  But I am at a loss to know, son, whether I should first inquire into the wrong done you, or mourn the dead. Your own sorrows, I think, are enough for you, unhappy man, without mourning for those of your neighbor. You speak the truth.  Therefore tell me again what happened to you, and how they wronged you. They came for me in a ship elaborately ornamented, shining Odysseus, and he who fostered my father, and said—whether truly or falsely, I do not know—that since my father had perished, fate now forbade that anyone but I should take the towers of chiefly because of my yearning for the dead, that I might look upon him before burial, since I had never seen him.  Then, besides, theirs was a fine promise, if by accompanying them I might sack the towers of when, sped by breeze and oar, I approached bitter Sigeum.  When I landed, straightaway the entire army thronged around me with greetings, vowing that they saw their lost Achilles once more alive. when I had wept for him, went before long to the Atreids, to friends, as it was reasonable to suppose,—and claimed my father’s arms and all else that had been his.  O, their reply was bold and shameless! The tears came quick to my eyes as I sprang up in passionate anger and said in my bitterness, and left not one unsaid, if he was indeed to rob me of my arms.  At this point, stung by the abuse, though not given to anger, he answered,— And yet I do not blame him as much as I do those in power.  For a city hangs wholly on its leaders, and so does an army, but when men shatter law and order, it is the lessons of their teachers that corrupt them.  My tale is told in full.  May he who hates the Atreids be as dear to the gods as he is to me! Goddess of the hills, Earth all-nourishing, mother of Zeus himself, you through whose realm the great Pactolus rolls golden sands!  There, there also, dread Mother, I called upon your name, when all the insults of the Atreids landed upon this man, when they handed over his father’s armor, that sublime marvel, to the son of It seems that you have come to me, friends, well commended by a grief that matches my own. Your story is in harmony with mine, so that I can recognize the work of the Atreids and of Odysseus.  For well I know that he would put his tongue to any base tale and to any mischief-making, if thereby he could hope to  accomplish something criminal in the end. No, that is not at all a wonder to me, but rather that the elder Ajax, if he was there, could bear to see this. Ah, friend, he was no longer alive—I would never have been plundered like that while he lived. What do you say?  Is he, too, dead and gone? Think of him as of one who sees the sun’s light no more. Oh, no!  But the son of Tydeus, and Sisyphus’ offspring that was bought by Laertes—they will not die, since they do not deserve to live! No, indeed, be sure of it.  On the contrary, they prosper now —yes, and greatly—in the And what of my brave old friend, Nestor of Pylos—is he not alive?  He often checked the crimes of those two, if not others, by his sage counsels. He has his own troubles now, since Antilochus, the son that was at his side, left him for Hades. Ah, me!  These two, again, whom you have named, are men of whose death I had least wished to hear.  Gods! What are we to look for, when these men have died, but Odysseus here again lives, when in their place he should have been announced as dead? The man is a clever wrestler.  But even clever schemes, Philoctetes, are often blocked. Now, by the gods, tell me—where was Patroclus when you needed him, he whom your father loved beyond all others? He, too, was dead.  And in a brief maxim I would teach you this:  War takes no evil man by choice, but always the good men. I will attest to that, and with that very truth in mind, I will ask you how fares a man of little worth, but sharp of tongue and clever. Surely the man of whom you ask is no one but Odysseus? I did not mean him;  there was one Thersites, who could never be content to speak once and briefly, even though no one wanted him to speak at all.  Do you know if he is alive? I never saw him, but I heard that he is still alive. He would be—no evil thing has ever been known to perish.  No, the gods take excellent care of their kind.  They find a strange joy in turning back from Hades all things criminal and crooked, while they are always dispatching the just and the good from life.  How am I to regard these doings?  How can I praise them, when in the very act of praising the ways of the gods, I find that the gods are evil? I, at least, son of Oetean Poeas, will be on my guard hereafter against and the Atreids, and look on them only from afar.  And where the worse man is stronger than the good, where nobility goes to ruin and the vile man dominates—among such men I will never make my friends.  No, rocky Scyros shall suffice for me from now on to make me delight in my home.  Now to my ship!  And you, son of Poeas, farewell—as best you can, farewell!  May the gods free you of your disease, just as you wish!  But we must be going, so that we may set sail whenever the god permits our voyage. Are you setting out already, son? Yes, since opportunity bids us watch near our ship for a fair wind, rather than from afar. Now by your father and by your mother, son, by all that you cherish at home— I solemnly supplicate you, do not leave me alone like this, helpless amid these miseries in which I live, so harsh as you see, and so numerous as I have said!  Consider me a small side-task.  Great is your disgust, well I know, at such a cargo.  Yet bear with it all the same—to noble minds baseness is hateful, and a good deed is glorious.  If you forsake this task, you will have a stain on your honor;  but if you perform it, boy, you will win the prize of highest honor—if I return alive to Oeta’s soil. Come, the trouble will not last one full day.  Endure it, take me and throw me where you will—in the hold, the prow, the stern, wherever I will least annoy my shipmates.  Say yes, by the great god of suppliants, son; be persuaded!  I supplicate you at your knees, I am an infirm wretch, and lame!  Do not leave me desolate like this, far from the paths of mankind!  No, bring me safely to your own home, or to and from there it will be no long journey for me to Oeta and the Trachinian heights, and fair-flowing Spercheius, so that you may show me to my beloved father, though long I have feared that he may have departed me.  For often did I summon him by means of those who came here, sending imploring prayers that he would himself send a ship and get me safely home.  But either he is dead, or else, as I think is likely, my messengers thought my concerns of little account and hurried on their homeward voyage. Now, however, since in you I have found one who can be both an escort and a messenger, save me and show me mercy, keeping in mind that all human destiny is full of the fear and the danger that prosperity may be followed by its opposite.  He who stands clear of trouble must beware of dangers, and when a man lives at ease, then it is that he must look most closely to his livelihood, lest it secretly suffer ruin. Have pity, my king!  He has told of a struggle with sufferings manifold and oppressive—may the like befall no friend of mine! And if, my king, you hate the hateful Atreids, then, turning their wrongdoing to this man’s gain, I would take him  in your swift, well-rigged ship to the home for which he longs, and so escape the god’s just wrath. Though now as a casual spectator you are compliant, beware lest later, when filled with his disease by its constant company, you prove no longer constant to these sentiments. That will not happen.  You will never have just cause to rebuke me for that! Well, then, it would shame me if the stranger were to find me less ready than you are to toil for his good.  Come, if it pleases you, let us sail.  Let the man set out at once;  our ship, for her part, will carry him, and will not refuse.  Only may the gods give us safe passage from this land, and from here to whatever destination we choose! O day of joy unsurpassed!  Most delightful man, and you good sailors!  If only I could show you in deeds what a true friend you have made in me!  Let us be going, my son, when we two have made a solemn farewell to my homeless home inside, so that you may also learn by what means I sustained my life, and how stout of heart I was born.  For I believe that the mere sight would have deterred any other man but me from enduring these sufferings.  But I have been slowly schooled by necessity to endure misery. Wait, let us listen to the two men who are coming! One is a crewman of your ship, the other a stranger.  Go in after you hear their report. Son of Achilles, I asked my companion here, when he was guarding your ship with two others, to tell me where you might be found, since I have chanced upon you unexpectedly by the good fortune of coming to anchor off this very coast.  With no great company I am homeward bound on my trader’s voyage from were all of your crew, I resolved not to continue my voyage in silence, without first giving you my news and getting the due reward.  You know nothing, I suspect, of your own affairs:  the new designs the Greeks have regarding you, and not only designs, but deeds in progress and no longer postponed. The service you have done me by your forethought, sir, unless I am unworthy, will remain in my grateful thoughts.  But tell me just what the designs are that you mentioned, so that I may understand what is the strange plan of the Greeks that you know. Pursuers are on the way in search of you with a fleet.  They are the aged Phoenix and the sons of Theseus. To bring me back by force, or through persuasion? I do not know; but I have come to tell you what I did hear. Are Phoenix and his comrades really so eager to do this favor for the Atreids? Be sure that it is being done, and without delay. Then why was Odysseus not ready to sail on this mission, and bring the message himself?  Or did some fear hold him back? Oh, he and the son of Tydeus were readying for pursuit of another man, just as I was leaving port. Who is this other after whom Odysseus himself was sailing? There was a man. . . . But tell me first who that is over there.  And whatever you say, do speak quietly. There, sir, before your eyes is the renowned Philoctetes. Then do not question me further, but get yourself out of here as quickly as possible and sail away. What is he saying, boy?  Why does the sailor traffic with you about me in these dark whispers? His meaning yet eludes me.  But, whatever he will say, he must say openly—to you, me and my men here. Seed of Achilles, do not stir the army’s resentment against me for saying what I should not.  I receive many benefits for what services I do them, as a poor man may. I am the enemy of the Atreids, and this man is my closest friend precisely because he hates them.  Since, then, you have come kindly disposed towards me, you must not hide from us any part of their plans that you have heard. Beware of what you are doing, boy. I am well aware. I will hold you accountable. Do so, but speak. I will.  It is after this man that those two whom I named to you, Diomedes and forceful Odysseus, are sailing.  They are oath-bound to retrieve him, either by winning words or by overpowering might. And all the Achaeans heard this clearly from the mouth Odysseus, for his confidence of success in this action was higher than his comrade’s. And for the sake of what did the Atreids after so long a time turn their thoughts so urgently towards this man, whom they were long since keeping an outcast?  What was the desire that came over them, or what force?  What avenging spirit sent by the gods to exact payment for evil deeds? I will inform you of all that, since it seems that you have not heard.  There was a seer of noble birth, a son of Priam, called Helenus, whom that man, out on a solitary night raid—that deceitful Odysseus, whose repute is all shame and dishonor—captured.  Leading him back in bonds, he displayed him publicly to the Achaeans as his glorious prey. Helenus then prophesied for them whatever matter they asked, and, pertaining to immediately promised that he would bring the man and show him to the Achaeans.  He thought it most likely that he would get him willingly, but, if unwilling, then by force, and he added that, were he to fail in this, whoever wished it might sever his head. You have heard everything, boy, and I advise speed for you, and for any man for whom you care. Alas!  Has he, the utter plague, sworn to fetch me back to the Achaeans by persuasion?  For if that were to happen, I could be persuaded, when dead, to come back up from Hades into the light, as his father did! I know nothing about that.  But for my part I must return to ship, while for you I pray that god may help you in every possible way. Now is it not astounding, boy, that Odysseus would ever have expected by means of soft words to lead me from his ship and show me in the middle of the Greeks?  No!  I would sooner listen to that greatest and worst of my enemies, the viper which made me crippled as I am!  But there is nothing that he would not say or dare.  And now I know that he is coming here. Come, son, let us be moving, so that a wide sea may part us from the ship of Odysseus.  Let us go!  Good speed in good season brings sleep and rest when toil is finished. Then as soon as the wind is not at our prow, we will sail.  At present it blows against us. The sailing is always fair, when you flee trouble. Not so;  this weather is against them also. No wind stands in the way of pirates who sense a chance to steal and plunder by force. Well, if you are so resolved, let us go, once you have taken from the cave whatever you need or desire most. Yes, there are some things that I need, though the choice is not large. What is there that will not be available on board my ship? I have a store of a certain herb, whereby I can always best lull this wound, until it is wholly tamed. Fetch it, then.  Now, what else do you wish to take? Any of these arrows that may have been forgotten, and may have slipped away from me, so that I not leave it for another to take. Is that indeed the famous bow which you hold? This, and no other, that I carry in my hand. Is there any way that I might have a closer view of it—and handle it, and salute it as divine? To you alone, my son, this shall be granted, along with anything else in my power that is in your interest. I do indeed crave to touch it, but my craving takes this form:  if it is lawful, I would be glad.  If not, think no more of it. Your words are reverent, son, and your wish is lawful.  For you alone have given to my eyes the light of life and the hope of seeing the land of Oeta, of seeing my aged father and my friends;  and you alone, when I lay beneath the feet of my enemies, have lifted me beyond their reach.  Be bold.  The bow shall be yours to handle and to return to the hand that gave it, and you will be able to boast aloud that in reward for your goodness, you alone of mortals have touched it. Yes, it was by a good deed that I myself won it. I am not sorry that I found you and have gained your friendship, since whoever knows how to render benefit for a benefit received must prove a friend more valuable than any possession.  Please, do go inside. Agreed, and I will bring you also. My sickness craves the comfort of your presence. I have heard a rumor, but never seen with my eyes, how the man who once approached the bed of Zeus was bound upon a swift wheel by the almighty son of Cronus.  But of no other mortal do I know, either by hearsay or by sight, that has encountered a doom so repugnant as this of Philoctetes.  For though he had wronged no one by force or thievery, but conducted himself fairly towards the fair, he was left to perish so undeservedly.  I truly marvel how—how in the world—as he listened in solitude to the breakers rushing around him, he kept his hold upon a life so full of grief. Here, he alone was his own neighbor, powerless to walk, with no one in the land to be his companion while he suffered—no one to whom he could cry out a lament that would be answered for the plague that gnawed his flesh and drained his blood—no one to lull with healing herbs gathered from the nourishing earth the burning blood which oozed from the ulcers of his envenomed foot, whenever the torment attacked him.  Instead he would then creep this way or that, stumbling like a child without his kind nurse, to any place from where his needs might be supplied, whenever the devouring anguish withdrew. For food he did not gather the fruit of holy Earth, nor anything else that we mortals feed on by our labor, except when on occasion he obtained food to ease his hunger by means of feathered shafts from his swift-striking bow.  Ah, joyless was his life, who for ten years never knew the delight of wine, but ever directed his path towards any stagnant pool that he could find as he gazed around him. But now, after those troubles, he will attain happiness and heartiness in the end because of his meeting with this son of a noble race, who after the fullness of many months carries him aboard our sea-crossing hull to his ancestral home, the haunt of Malian nymphs, and to the banks of the Spercheius in that very land where, above Oeta’s heights, the hero of the brazen shield approached the gods, illuminated by his father’s divine fire. Please, come on.  Why so silent with no apparent cause?  And why are you paralyzed? Ai, ai! What is the matter? Nothing serious—go on, son. Are you in pain from the disease that frequents you? No, indeed no.  I think it is better now.—Gods, oh! Why do you groan like this and call on the gods? That they may come to me with power to save and soothe.—Ai!  Ai! What troubles you?  Speak, do not keep so silent.  It is plain enough that you are suffering somehow. I am destroyed, boy—I can never conceal my suffering when you are close.  Ah!  Ah!  It shoots through me, shoots straight through!  Oh, the pain,the misery! I am destroyed, boy—I am devoured!  Ah, by the gods I beg you, if you have a sword ready to hand, strike at my ankle—cut it off now!  Do not spare my life! Quick, boy, quick! What new thing has come on you so suddenly that you wail for yourself with these loud shrieks? You know, son. What is it? You know, boy. What ails you?  I do not know. How could you not know?  Oh, oh! Yes, terrible is the burden of your disease. Terrible beyond telling!  Oh, pity me! What shall I do? Do not betray me because of fear.  This plague comes only now and then,—perhaps when she has been sated with her roamings elsewhere. Ah, poor wretch!  Poor man, truly for all your sufferings!  Shall I support you, or somehow offer a helping hand? No, no.  But take this bow of mine—as you earlier asked of me—and keep it in your care and safe until this present bout with my disease is past.  For indeed sleep takes me as soon as this pain passes away, nor can it cease before then.   But you must allow me to sleep in peace.  And if those men come in the meantime, then by the gods I forbid you willingly or unwillingly, or by any skilled trickery, to give up this bow to them, lest you bring destruction at once on yourself and on me, who am your suppliant. Have no fears as to my caution.  The bow shall pass into no hands but yours and mine.  Give it to me, and may good luck accompany it! There, take it boy.  And humble yourself before the jealous gods, so that the bow may not prove baneful for you, as it did for me and for him who owned it before me. O gods, grant this to the two of us!  And grant us a voyage prosperous and unimpeded, to whatever goal the god may deem right and that our mission provides! Futile, I fear, are your prayers, boy.  Look, once again the dark blood is oozing drop by drop from deep in the wound, and I look for worse to come. Ah, me, oh, oh!  Cursed foot, what torment you cause me!  It creeps on me, it is coming near!  Ah, misery!  Now you know my condition.  Do not flee, no! Oh, alas!  Odysseus of Cephallene, once my friend, would that this anguish might stick to you, and pierce your chest!  Ah, me!  Ah, me!  O you twin marshalls, Agamemnon, and you, Menelaus, may your flesh instead of mine nourish this plague, and for as long!  Oh, Ah, me!  O Death, Death, though I am always summoning you day after day, why do you never come?  O son, noble youth, seize me, burn me up, true friend, in that fire famed as Lemnian.  I, too, once deemed it lawful to do that very service for the son of Zeus, in return for which I received these same arms, which are now in your keeping.  What do you say, boy, what do you say? Why this silence?  Where are your thoughts, son? My heart has long been aching for your load of pain. Stop, then, and take courage;  this visitor comes sharply, but goes quickly.  Yet, I beg you, do not leave me alone. Take heart, we will remain. Will you? Be sure of it. Indeed, I do not think it right to put you under oath. Rest assured;  it is not lawful for me to leave without you. Give me your hand in pledge! I give it—to stay. Now take me there, over there! Where do you mean? Up there! What is this new delirium?  Why do you gaze at the dome above us? Let me go, let me go! Where will you go, if I do so? Let me go, I say! I will not. You will kill me, if you touch me further. There, then, I release you—if in fact you believe it is for the better. Wide Earth, embrace me now on the verge of death! This pain no longer lets me stand up. Sleep, I think, will take him before long.  See, his head sinks backward.  Yes, a sweat runs over his whole body, and a dark, hemorrhaging vein has burst from his heel. Come, friends, let us leave him in quietness, so that he may fall asleep. Divine Sleep, god who knows no pain, Sleep, stranger to anguish, come in favor to us, come happy, and giving happiness, great King! Keep before his eyes such light as is spread before them now.  Come to him, I pray you, come with power to heal!  Son, consider what position you will take, and to what strategy you will next direct our course. You see his condition now!  Why should we hesitate to act?  Opportunity, the umpire of all contests, often wins a great victory by one swift stroke. No, even though he hears nothing, I see that we have made this bow our quarry to no end, if we sail without him.  His must be the victor’s crown.  It is he that the god commanded we bring.  It would be a foul disgrace upon us to boast of deeds in which failure and fraud had equal parts. Well, the god must look to that, son.  But when you answer me again, softly, please, softly whisper your words.  For sick men’s restless sleep is quick to vision.  But, please, use your utmost care to win that prize, that great prize, by stealth.  For if you maintain your present purpose towards this man—you know what purpose I mean—then truly there are irremediable troubles in store, which a shrewd mind can foresee. Now, son, a fair wind blows you on your way:  sightless and helpless, the man lies stretched in darkness—sleep in the heat is sound— with no command of hands or feet, but stripped of all his powers, like one who rests with Hades.  Take note, see if your pronouncements are seasonable.  So far as my thoughts can seize the truth, boy, the best strategy is that which stirs no alarm. Quiet, I say, and do not abandon your wits—the man is opening his eyes and lifts his head. Ah, light succeeding upon sleep!  Ah, friendly watchers, sight unlooked for even in my dreams!  I could never have expected this, son— that you would have the patience to wait so tenderly upon my sufferings by staying close beside me and helping to relieve me.  The Atreids, certainly, those valiant generals, had no heart to bear this burden so lightly.  But your nature is noble and drawn of a noble line, and so you have made little of all this, though loud cries and stenches afflicted you.  And now, since the plague seems to allow me a space of forgetfulness and peace at last, lift me up yourself and set me on my feet, so that, when the faintness releases me at length, we may set out to the ship, and not hold back our sailing. It pleases me to see you living unpained and breathing still, however contrary to my expectation.  For in view of your persistent sufferings, your symptoms seemed to speak of death.  But now lift yourself, or, if you prefer, these men will carry you. The labor will not be grudged, since you and I are of one mind. Thank you, son, and help me up, as you will. Yet do not trouble your men, so that they may not suffer from the foul stench before it is necessary.  It will be trial enough for them to live on board with me. So be it.  Now stand up, and take hold of me. Do not worry, my habitual method will help me to my feet. God!  What am I to do next? What is the matter?  Where strays your speech? I do not know where to turn my tongue when my thoughts are so confused. Confused?  How so?  No, do not say it! My mind is indeed brought to that condition. It cannot be that offense at my sickness has persuaded you not to take me aboard your ship? All is offense when a man has abandoned his true nature and does what does not suit him. But you, at least, are not departing from your begetter’s example either in word or deed, when you help a man who is noble. I shall be found to have no honor—this is the thought that long torments me. Not because of your present deeds, at least.  But because of your words, I worry. O Zeus, what shall I do?  Must I be twice found base—by disloyal silence, as well as by shameful speech? Unless I am lacking in judgment, he means to betray me, leave me behind and sail away! Leave you?  No, not I.  Rather, to your pain, I will bring you along.  That is my torment. What do you mean, son?  I do not understand. I will conceal nothing.  You must sail to Ah, no!  What have you said? Do not wail in grief, before you understand! Understand what?  What do you intend to do to me? Save you, first, from this misery, and then, together with you, go and plunder And this is your true intent? A harsh necessity governs these events, so do not be angered at hearing of them. I am destroyed—ah, misery!—betrayed!  What have you done to me, stranger?  Return my bow at once! No, it is not possible.  My duty and my interest alike constrain me to obey those in power. You destroying fire, you utter monster, you hateful masterpiece of astounding wickedness!  What treachery you have done to me!  How thoroughly you have deceived me!  And are you, you wretch, unashamed to look at me, the suppliant who turned to you for mercy?  In taking my bow, you have robbed me of my life.  Return it, I beg you, return it, I pray you, son!  By the gods of your fathers, do not rob me of my life!  Ah, me!  He speaks to me no more. He looks away, as if he will never give it up!  O you inlets and headlands, you wild creatures of the hills who have shared my life, and you jagged cliffs, to you—for you alone hear me—to you my accustomed companions, I bewail the treacherous treatment I have received from the son of Achilles.  Although he swore to take me to my home, it is to By force he drags me away, as if he had captured a strong man, and does not see that he is cutting down a corpse, the shadow of smoke, a mere phantom.  In my strength he could not have taken me—no!—nor even in my present condition, save by deceit.  But now, because of my rotten fate, I have been tricked.  What should I do? Wait, give it back!  Now, at least, recover your true self!  What do you say?  Silence!  I am nothing!  Double-gated cave, back, back again I return to you, but now stripped and lacking the means to live.  Yes, in that chamber I will wither away alone, bringing down with that bow no winged bird, no beast that roams the hills.  Rather I myself shall die in misery, and supply a feast for those who fed me, becoming the prey of those on whom I preyed.  Ah, in requital for blood my own blood will flow, shed at the hands of a man who seemed all unknowing of evil!  May destruction seize you!—but no, not yet, not before I learn whether you will change your mind.  But if not, may you die a cruel death! What shall we do?  It rests with you, my king, whether we now sail, or move forward to answer his pleas. A startling pity for him has come upon me—and not now for the first time, but long ago. Show mercy, boy, for the love of the gods, and do not give men cause to reproach you for having cheated me. Ah, no, what shall I do?  I wish I had never left Scyros, so pained am I by these doings. You are not in and of yourself wicked, but you seem to have come to me after learning the shameless lessons of wicked masters.  Now leave such behavior to others, whom it suits, and sail from here—once you have given me back my weapons. What shall we do, friends? Traitor, what are you doing?  Come back here and surrender that bow to me! Who is that?  Do I hear Odysseus? Yes, Odysseus, be sure of it.  Here I am before your eyes. Ah, me, I am sold, destroyed!  It was he, then, who entrapped me and robbed me of my arms. Yes, I and no other.  I avow it. Give back my bow, boy, give it up. That he shall never do, even if he wished to.  And, what is more, you must come along with it, or my men will bring you by force. Me, you basest and boldest of scoundrels, they will take me by force? Unless you come of your own free will. O Zeus it is, I tell you, Zeus, who rules this land, and it is by Zeus that these actions are decreed.  I am his servant. Hated creature, what clever pleading you devise! By sheltering yourself behind the gods, you make the gods liars. No, but true prophets.  Now our march must begin. Never! Now, I say.  You must obey. Ah, misery!  Clearly, then, my father sired me to be a slave and no free man. Not so, but to be the peer of the best and bravest, with whom you are destined to take No, never—even if I must suffer every torment, so long as I have this island’s steep cliffs beneath me! What do you plan to do? Throw myself now from the rock and shatter my head on the rocks below! Quick, seize him, both of you!  Do not give him the chance! O my arms, what shames you suffer for lack of your cherished bow, now that you are made that man’s bound quarry!  And you, who cannot think one healthy or one noble thought, how stealthily you have once more ambushed and trapped me, taking this boy for your screen, because he was a stranger to me.  He is too good for your company, but worthy of mine, since he had no thought but to execute his orders, and he already shows remorse for his own errors and for the wrongs done me.  But your corrupt mind, always on the lookout from some position of ambush, trained him well—unsuited and unwilling though he was— to be cunning in evil.  And now, wretch, for me you plan bonds and passage from the very shore on which you had me flung away, friendless, abandoned, citiless, a corpse in the eyes of the living.  Ah!  Hades take you!  Indeed I have often so prayed for you. But, because the gods grant me nothing that is sweet, you remain alive and you laugh, while I live miserably among countless sufferings, mocked by you and by the sons of Atreus, the two generals whom you serve on this errand. And yet you sailed with them only when brought under their yoke by trickery and compulsion.  But me, when, to my utter ruin, I sailed of my own accord as their mate with seven ships, me they cast out of ship and honor, as you claim, while they say that it was your doing.  And now, why would you take me?  Why have me led away?  For what purpose? I am nothing, and, as far as you were concerned, I have long been dead.  You creature abhorred by the gods, how is it that you no longer find me crippled and foul-smelling?  How, if I sail with you, can you burn sacrifices to the gods, or make libations any more?  That was your pretext for casting me away in the first place. A cruel death for you!—and die you shall for your unjust treatment of me, if the gods care for justice.  But I know that they do care for it, since you would never have made this voyage for one so miserable, unless some god-sent goad had driven you after me. O, fatherland, and you watchful gods, bring your vengeance, bring your vengeance on them all after so long, if at all you pity me!  Yes, my life merits pity.  Yet if I were to see those men overthrown, I would believe that I had escaped my plague. Bitter is the stranger, and bitter his words, Odysseus.  They do not bend before the storm of his troubles. I could say much in answer to his claims, if time allowed;  but now I can say one thing only.  What kind of man the occasion demands, that kind of man am I. And accordingly, where the judgment at hand is of just and good men, you could find no man more pious than me.  Victory, however, is my inborn desire in every field—save with regard to you.  To you, in this case, I will gladly give way.  Yes, release him, and lay not another finger upon him. Let him stay here.  We have no further need of you, now that we have these weapons.  For Teucer is there among our forces, well-skilled in this craft, as am I, and I believe that I can master this bow in no way worse than you, and point it with no worse a hand. So what need is there of you?  Farewell!  Enjoy your strolls on Ah, no, what shall I do?  Are you to shine before the Argives graced with my arms? Argue with me no more.  I am going. Seed of Achilles, will you, too, grant me your voice no more, but leave without a word? Come on!  Do not look at him, kind and noble though you are.  Do not obliterate our good fortune. And will you also, friends, leave me so desolate and show me no pity? The boy commands our ship.  Whatever he says to you, that is our answer also. I shall be told by Odysseus here that I am too soft-hearted;  but remain here, if that one agrees, until the sailors have readied everything on board, and we have made our prayers to the gods.  In the interval, perhaps, he will obtain a better attitude towards us.  And so we two are going. And you, when we call you, be quick to come. Hollow in the caverned rock, now hot, now frosty, how true it seems, then, that I was sadly fated never to leave you! No, you will witness my death, too.  Ah, ah, me!  Sad dwelling, so long filled with the pain welling from my flesh, what will be my daily portion hereafter? Where, from what provision, shall I, unhappy, find any hope of sustenance?  Above my head the tremulous doves will go on their way through the whistling wind.  I can stop their flight no more. It was you, you, I say, doomed one, that chose this fate;  and this fortune to which you are captive comes from no other source, nor from a stronger man’s compulsion.  For when in fact it was in your power to show sense, you chose to reject the better fate, and to accept the worse. Ah, miserable, miserable, then, am I, and shamed by hardship, who next must hereafter dwell in my misery here, with no man for companion in the days to come, and waste away.  I can no longer bring food to my home, no longer gain it by the winged weapons held in my strong hands.  But the unsuspected and stealthy fictions of a treacherous mind deceived me.  If only I could watch him, the contriver of this plot, doomed to endure my anguish for as long a time! Doom, god-sent doom constrained you to suffer this, not, I tell you, any treachery to which my hand was lent. Aim your hate-filled, baneful curse elsewhere, since I prefer that you not reject my friendship. Alas!  No doubt sitting on the white ocean shore he mocks me, brandishing the weapon that nourished my unhappy life, the weapon which no one else had carried!  Cherished bow, ah, friend forced from my loving hands, if you have the power to feel, surely you see with pity that the comrade of Heracles will now no longer use you anymore! Now you are handled by another, a man of craftiness; you see the shameless deceptions and the face of that hated enemy by whom countless wrongs, springing from shameless designs, have been contrived against me.  O Zeus! A man must always assert what is right.  But, when he has done so, he must not let loose malignant, stinging taunts.  The man was the sole representative of the whole army, and at their mandate he achieved a universal benefit for his friends. Ah, my winged prey, and you tribes of bright-eyed creatures held by this place in its upland pastures, leap no more in flight from your lairs, for I do not grasp in my hands those shafts which were once my strength—but now, gone, are my undoing!  Roam at will now; the place has no more terrors—for you! The time is ripe for you to take blood for blood, to sate yourselves to your heart’s desire on my discolored flesh!  Soon I will leave life, for from what source can I find the means to live?  Who can feed, as I will have to, on the winds, when he no longer owns any of the bounty that the life-giving earth supplies? In the name of the gods, if you have any reverence for a friend who approaches you in all kindness, approach him! But know this, and know it well:  it is in your power to escape this plague.  Cruel is it that you feed it with your own flesh, and that there is no way for you to learn to endure the countless torments that dwell with it. Again, again, you have recalled the old agony to my thoughts—kindest though you are of all who have visited before!  Why have you ruined me?  What have you done to me? What do you mean? That it was your hope to take me to that Trojan land I abhor. Yes, I believe that to be the best course. Leave me, then—immediately! Pleasant, pleasant, indeed, is the task you set me, and I am ready to obey. Come, let us be going, each to his station in the ship! By Zeus who hears men’s curses, do not go, I implore you! Be moderate. Friends, in the name of the gods, stay! Why do you call? Ayee, ayee!  Doom, Doom!  My suffering kills me!  Foot, my foot, what shall I do with you in the days to come? O friends, return, come back to me! To do what that has a different spirit from that of your former commands? There is no reason for indignation when the words of one crazed by a storm of pain are senseless. Come with us, then, poor man, as we bid you. Never, never—of that be certain!  Not even if the lord of the fiery lightning comes to wrap me in the blaze of his thunderbolts!  What would you ask? A sword, if you can find one, or an axe, or any weapon— please, pass it to me! That you may execute what scheme? Mangle all this body, and sever limb from limb with my own hand!  Death, death is my thought now! Why, why ever would you— I am seeking my father— In what land? In Hades;  he dwells in the sunlight no more.  Ah, my city, city of my fathers!  I crave to see you, unhappy man that I truly am for leaving your sacred stream and going to help the Danaans, my enemies!  I am nothing now, nothing anymore! Long ago I would have left you to go to my ship, had I not seen Odysseus approaching, and the son of Achilles, too, coming here for us. Will you not tell me why you make this return journey with such eager speed? I come to undo the mistake that I made earlier. Your words alarm me—what mistake was that? The one I made when I obeyed you and all the army. What did you do that was unworthy of you? I captured a man by disgraceful deceits and treachery. What man?  Oh!  Can you be planning something rash? Rash, no.  But to Poeas’ son— What are you going to do?  Suddenly a certain fear comes over me. —From whom I took this bow, back to him— Zeus!  What will you say?  Certainly you do not intend to give it back? Yes, I do, because disgracefully and unjustly I got hold of it. In the name of the gods, are you saying this to mock me? If it is mockery to speak the truth. What  do you mean, Neoptolemus?  What are you saying? Must I repeat the same words twice and three times? I would not have wished to hear them even once. Know for certain that I have nothing more to say. There is someone, I tell you, who will prevent your deed. What do you mean?  Who will oppose me in this? The whole host of the Achaeans, and I for one. Wise though you were born, your threats are void of wisdom. And your words are not wise, nor is that which you want to do. And yet if they are just, they are better than wise. And how is it just for you to give up what was won by means of my plans? My error was to my dishonor, and now I must try to retrieve it. The army of the Achaeans causes you no fear, when you do this? With justice on my side, I do not tremble at the terrors you name. No, not even at the threat of your hand do I yield obedience. Then our battles shall be not with the Trojans, but with you. So be it, if that is what the future holds. Do you see my right hand clasping my sword hilt? You will see me do the same, and not slowly. However, I will let you be.  But I will go report this to all the army, and by them you will be punished. You have come to your senses.  And if you are so prudent hereafter, perhaps you may steer clear of trouble. What is this disruptive cry once more rising beside my cave? Why do you call me?  What do you want of me? Oh, no!  This business will bring me no good.  Have you come bringing me new misery on top of the old? Take heart and listen to my words. I am afraid.  Beautiful words did me evil once before, when I believed your promises. Is there no room, then, for repentance? You spoke just like this, when you were seeking to steal my bow—a professed friend, with my destruction in his treacherous heart. I assure you, I am not so now.  I merely wish to know whether you have resolved to stay here and endure, or to sail with us. Stop, not another word!  Whatever you may say will be said in vain. You are so resolved? More firmly, believe me, than words can say. Well, I could have wished that you had listened to my words, but if nothing that I say will help,then I am finished. Yes, all your pleas will be in vain. Ruin seize you all, the Atreids first, and next the son of Speak no more curses, and instead receive these weapons from my hand. What did you say?  Am I being tricked a second time? No, I swear it by the pure majesty of Zeus most high! O welcome words—if your words are true! The deed will soon make it plain.  Come, stretch out your right hand and be master of your bow! But I forbid it, as the gods are my witnesses, in the name of the Atreids and the entire army! Son, whose voice was that?  Do I hear Odysseus? Be sure of it, and you see him at your side, who will carry you to the plains of But it will bring you no joy, if this arrow fly straight. Wait—by the gods, no!  Do not let it fly! Let go of me, in the name of the gods, dear boy! I will not. Alas!  Why did you take from me the chance to kill my hated enemy with my bow? It would have been honorable neither for me, nor for you. Well, you may be sure of one thing, at least:  the army’s chiefs, the lying heralds of the Greeks, though bold with words, are cowards in the fight. Good;  the bow is yours, and you have no cause for anger or complaint against me. Agreed.  You have revealed the true stock, my son, from which you spring.  You are no child of Sisyphus, but of Achilles, whose fame was the fairest when he was among the living, as it is now with the dead. I delight at your praise of my father, and of myself.  But hear what I desire to gain from you.  It is true that men are compelled to bear the fortunes given by the gods;  but when they cling to self-inflicted miseries, as you do, no one can justly excuse or pity them.  You have become savage:  you welcome no counsellor, and if someone admonishes you, even if he speaks in all good will, you detest him and consider him an enemy who wishes you ill.  All the same I will speak to you, calling Zeus who guards oaths to witness. And you remember these words and write them in your heart:  you suffer this plague’s affliction in accordance with god-sent fate, because you came near to as long as the sun still rises in the east and sets in the west, until of your own free will you come to the plains of aid and mine, be hailed as the sacker of that this very summer must see the complete capture of as best of the Greeks—first, for coming into healing hands, and then for taking Hateful life, why, why do you keep me in the light of day, instead of letting me go to Hades’ domain? Ah, me, what shall I do?  How can I ignore this man’s words, when he has advised me with good will?  But shall I yield, then?  How, after doing that, shall I, ill-fated, come into men’s sight?  Whom will I be able to talk to?  You orbs that have watched my every suffering, how could you endure to see me consorting with the sons of Atreus, who caused my ruin, or with the accursed son of these men in the future.  For when the mind of men has once mothered wrongdoing, it trains those men to be wrongdoers in all else thereafter.  And in you, too, I wonder at this.  You should never yourself revisit by stripping you of your father’s arms So shall you win double thanks from me, as from your father, and you will not appear through your service to bad men to be like them in your nature. Your recommendation is reasonable, but nevertheless, I wish that you would put your trust in the gods and in my words, and sail from this land with me, your friend. What!  To the plains of No, rather to those who will free you and your pus-filled limb from pain, and will save you from your sickness. You giver of frightening advice, what have you said? I recognize what will be best in the end for you and for me. Have you no shame before the gods for saying that? Why should a man be ashamed of benefiting his friends? Do you mean a benefit to the Atreids, or for me? For you, certainly, since I am your friend and speak in friendship. How can that be, when you would give me up to my enemies? Please, sir, learn to be less defiant in misfortune. You will ruin me—I know it—with these words. Not I.  But you, I say, will not understand. Do I not know already that the Atreids cast me away? They cast you out, yes, but look if they will not in turn restore you. Never—if I must first consent to see What can I do, then if my pleading fails to persuade you of anything that I recommend? The easiest course for me is to stop talking, and for you to live, just as you do now, without deliverance. Let me bear the sufferings that are fated me.  But what you promised me with your right hand in mine—to bring me home,—that promise fulfil for me, son, and do not delay, or remind me further of If it is your will, let us go. O noble words! Now lean your steps firmly upon mine. As far as my strength allows. But how shall I escape blame from the Achaeans? Disregard it. What if they ravage my country? I will be there— And what aid will you render? —And with the shafts of Heracles— What? —I will keep them away. Then say your farewell to this island, and leave with me. Not yet, not until you have heard my commands, son of Poeas.  Know that your ears perceive the voice of Heracles, and that you look upon his face.  For your sake I have left my divine seat and come to reveal to you the purposes of Zeus, and to halt the journey on which you are departing.  Hearken to my words. And for you, be sure, this fate is ordained, that through these toils of yours you will make your life far-famed. and then, chosen out as foremost among the warriors in prowess, with my bow you shall sever to the heights of your native Oeta for the delight of your father Poeas.  And whatever spoils you receive from that army, from them carry to my pyre a thank-offering for my bow.  And these counsels hold for you also, son of Achilles, for you have not the might to subdue the Trojan realm without him, nor he without you.  Rather, like twin lions with the same quarry, each of you must guard the other’s life.  For the healing of your sickness, I will send Asclepius to before my arrows.  But of this be mindful, when you plunder the land—that you show reverence towards the gods.  Do this because Father Zeus regards all else as of less account, and because Piety does not die along with mortals.  Whether they are alive or dead, their piety does not perish. Ah, friend whose voice I have longed to hear, whose shape I see at long last, I will not disobey your commands! I, too, consent. Then do not long delay, for the occasion and the fair wind there at your stern urge you forward. Come, then, let me hail this land as I depart.  Farewell, chamber that shared my watches.  Farewell, nymphs of stream and meadow, and you, strong pounding of the sea-lashed cape, where often in the cavern’s inmost recess my head was wetted by the south wind’s blasts, and where many times the Hermaean mount sent an echo to my sad groans in the gale of my sorrow!  But now, clear springs and Lycian fount, I am leaving you, leaving you at last, though such a hope had never buoyed me!  Farewell, sea-wrapped and send me off with sailing fair to my heart’s content, send me to the destination appointed me by mighty Fate and the will of my friends, and by the all-taming god who has brought these things to pass. Now let us all leave together, once we have prayed to the nymphs of the sea to come be the guides of our safe return.  \n",

And now, Hephaestus, yours is the charge to observe the mandates laid upon you by the Father—to clamp this miscreant upon the high craggy rocks in shackles of binding adamant that cannot be broken. For your own flower,  flashing fire, source of all arts, he has purloined and bestowed upon mortal creatures.  Such is his offence; for this he is bound to make requital to the gods, so that he may learn to bear with the sovereignty of Zeus and cease his man-loving ways. Power and Force, for you indeed the behest of Zeus is now fulfilled, and nothing remains to stop you.  But for me—I do not have the nerve myself to bind with force a kindred god upon this rocky cleft assailed by cruel winter.  Yet, come what may, I am constrained to summon courage to this deed; for it is perilous to disregard the commandments of the Father. no hand can loose to this desolate crag, where neither voice nor form of mortal man shall you perceive; but, scorched by the sun’s bright beams, you shall lose the fair bloom of your flesh.  And glad you shall be when spangled-robed night shall veil his brightness and when the sun shall scatter again the frost of morning.  Evermore the burden of your present ill shall wear you out; for your deliverer is not yet born. you bestowed honors upon mortal creatures beyond their due.  Therefore on this joyless rock you must stand sentinel, erect, sleepless, your knee unbent.  And many a groan and unavailing lament you shall utter; for the heart of Zeus is hard, and everyone is harsh whose power is new. Well, why delay and excite pity in vain?  Why do you not detest a god most hateful to the gods, since he has betrayed your prerogative to mortals? A strangely potent tie is kinship, and companionship as well. I agree; yet to refuse to obey the commands of the Father; is this possible?  Do you not fear that more? Yes, you are ever pitiless and steeped in insolence. Yes, for it does not good to bemoan this fellow.  Stop wasting  your labor at an unprofitable task. Oh handicraft that I hate so much! Why hate it?  Since in truth your craft is in no way to blame for these present troubles. Nevertheless, i wish it had fallen to another’s lot! Every job is troublesome except to be the commander of gods; no one is free except Zeus. I know it by this task; I cannot deny it. Hurry then to cast the fetters about him, so that the Father does not see you loitering. Well, there then!  The bands are ready, as you may see. Cast them about his wrists and with might strike with your hammer; rivet him to the rocks. There!  The work is getting done and not improperly. Strike harder, clamp him tight, leave nothing loose; for he is wondrously clever at finding a way even out of desperate straits. This arm, at least, is fixed permanently. Now rivet this one too and securely, so that he may learn, for all his cleverness, that he is a fool compared to Zeus. None but he could justly blame my work. Now drive the adamantine wedge’s stubborn edge straight through his chest with your full force. Alas, Prometheus, I groan for your sufferings. What! Shrinking again and groaning over the enemies of Zeus?  Take care, so that the day  does not come when  you shall grieve for yourself. You see a spectacle grievous for eyes to behold. I see this man getting his deserts. Come, cast the girths about his sides. I must do this;  spare me your needless ordering. Indeed, I’ll order you, yes and more—I’ll hound you on.  Get down below, and ring his legs by force. There now!  The work’s done and without much labor. Now hammer the piercing fetters with your full force; for the appraiser of our work is severe. The utterance of your tongue matches your looks. Be softhearted then, but do not attack my stubborn will and my harsh mood. Let us be gone, since he has got the fetters on his limbs. There now, indulge your insolence, keep on wresting from the gods their honors to give them to creatures of a day.  Are mortals able to lighten your load of sorrow? Falsely the gods call you Prometheus, O you bright sky of heaven, you swift-winged breezes, you river-waters, and infinite laughter of the waves of ocean, O universal mother Earth , and you, all-seeing orb of the sun, to you I call! See what I, a god, endure from the gods. Look, with what shameful torture I am racked and must wrestle throughout the countless years of time apportioned me.  Such is the ignominious bondage the new commander of the blessed has devised against me. Woe! Woe!  For present misery and misery to come I groan, not knowing where it is fated that deliverance from these sorrows shall arise. And yet, what am I saying?  All that is to be I know full well and in advance, nor shall any affliction come upon me unforeseen.  I must bear my allotted doom as lightly as I can, knowing that the might of Necessity permits no resistance.Yet I am not able to speak nor be silent about my fate.  For it is because I bestowed good gifts on mortals that this miserable yoke of constraint has been bound upon me.  I hunted out and stored in fennel stalk the stolen source of fire that has proved a teacher to mortals in every art and a means to mighty ends.  Such is the offence for which I pay the penalty, riveted in fetters beneath the open sky. Ha! Behold! What murmur, what scent wings to me, its source invisible, heavenly or human, or both?  Has someone come to this crag at the edge of the world to stare at my sufferings—or with what motive?  Behold me, an ill-fated god, chained, the foe of Zeus, hated of all who enter the court of Zeus, because of my very great love for mankind.  Ha!  What’s this? What may be this rustling stir of birds I hear again nearby?  The air whirs with the light rush of wings.  Whatever approaches causes me alarm. Do not fear!  For our group has come in swift rivalry of wings to this crag as friend to you, having won our father’s consent as best we might.  The swift-coursing breezes bore me on; for the reverberation of the clang of iron pierced the depths of our caves and drove my grave modesty away in fright; unsandalled I have hastened in a winged car. Alas! Alas!  Offspring of fruitful Tethys and of him who with his sleepless current encircles the whole earth, children of your father Oceanus, behold, see with what fetters, upon the summit crag of this ravine, I am to hold my unenviable watch. I see, Prometheus; and over my eyes a mist of tears and fear spread as I saw your body withering ignominiously upon this rock in these bonds of adamant.  For there are new rulers  in heaven, and Zeus governs with lawless customs; that which was mighty before he now brings to nothing. Oh if only he had hurled me below the earth, yes beneath Hades, the entertainer of the dead, into impassable Tartarus, and had ruthlessly fastened me in fetters no hand can loose, so that neither god nor any other might have gloated over this agony I feel! But, now, a miserable plaything of the winds, I suffer pains to delight my enemies. Who of the gods is so hard of heart as to exult in this?  Who does not sympathize with your woes—save only Zeus?  But he in malice, has set his soul inflexibly and keeps in subjection the race sprung from Uranus; nor will he stop, until he has satiated his soul or another seizes his impregnable empire by some device of guile. Truly the day shall come when, although I am tortured in stubborn fetters, the prince of the blessed will need me to reveal the new design whereby he shall be stripped of his sceptre and his dignities.  Not by persuasion’s honeyed enchantments will he charm me; and I will never, cowering before his dire threats, divulge this secret, until he releases me from my cruel bonds and provides compensation for this outrage. You are bold, and do not yield to your bitter pangs; you give too much license to your tongue.  But my soul is agitated by piercing fear, and I am in dread about your fate, wondering to what haven you must steer your ship to see an end of your voyage of sorrow.  For the heart of Cronus’ son is hardened against entreaty and his ways are inexorable. I know that Zeus is harsh and keeps justice in his own hands; but nevertheless one day his judgement will soften, when he has been crushed in the way that I know. as eager as I am to welcome him. Unfold the whole story and tell us upon what charge Zeus has caught you and painfully punishes you with such dishonor.  Instruct us, unless, indeed, there is some harm in telling. It is painful to me to tell the tale, painful to keep it silent. My case is unfortunate every way. the contrary end, that Zeus might never win mastery over the gods—it was then that I, although advising them for the best, was unable to persuade the Titans, children of Heaven and Earth; but they, disdaining counsels of craft, in the pride of their strength thought to gain the mastery without a struggle and by force.  Often my mother Themis, or Earth (though one form, she had many names), had foretold to me the way in which the future was fated to come to pass. That it was not by brute strength nor through violence, but by guile that those who should gain the upper hand were destined to prevail.  And though I argued all this to them, they did not pay any attention to my words.  With all that before me, it seemed best that, joining with my mother, I should place myself, a welcome volunteer, on the side of Zeus; and it is by reason of my counsel that the cavernous gloom of Tartarus now hides ancient Cronus and his allies within it.  Thus I helped the tyrant of the gods and with this foul payment he has responded; for it is a disease that is somehow inherent in tyranny to have no faith in friends. As soon as he had seated himself upon his father’s throne, he immediately assigned to the deities their several privileges and apportioned to them their proper powers.  But of wretched mortals he took no notice, desiring to bring the whole race to an end and create a new one in its place.  Against this purpose none dared make stand except me— I only had the courage; I saved mortals so that they did not descend, blasted utterly, to the house of Hades.  This is why I am bent by such grievous tortures, painful to suffer, piteous to behold.  I who gave mortals first place in my pity, I am deemed unworthy to win this pity for myself, but am in this way mercilessly disciplined, a spectacle that shames the glory of Zeus. Iron-hearted and made of stone, Prometheus, is he who feels no compassion at your miseries. For myself, I would not have desired to see them; and now that I see them, I am pained in my heart. Yes, to my friends indeed I am a spectacle of pity. Did you perhaps transgress even somewhat beyond this offence? Yes, I caused mortals to cease foreseeing their doom. Of what sort was the cure that you found for this affliction? I caused blind hopes to dwell within their breasts. A great benefit was this you gave to mortals. In addition, I gave them fire. What!  Do creatures of a day now have flame-eyed fire? Yes, and from it they shall learn many arts. Then it was on a charge like this that Zeus— Torments me and in no way gives me respite from pain. And is there no end assigned to your ordeal? No, none except when it seems good to him. But how will it seem good to him?  What hope is there? Do you not see that you have wronged?  And yet it is not pleasant for me to talk about how you have wronged, and for you it is pain.  So, let us quit this theme; and may you seek some release from your ordeal. It is easy for him who keeps his foot free from harm to counsel and admonish him who is in misery.  I have known this all the while. Of my own will, yes, of my own will I erred—I will not deny it. By helping mortals I found suffering for myself; nevertheless I did not think I would be punished in this way—wasting away upon cliffs in mid-air, my portion this desolate and dreary crag.  And now, bewail no more my present woes; alight on the ground and listen to my oncoming fortunes so that you may be told them from end to end.   Consent, I beg you, oh consent.  Take part in the trouble of him who is now in sore distress.  In truth, affliction wanders impartially abroad and alights upon all in turn. Not to unwilling ears have you made this appeal, Prometheus.  And so now with light foot I will quit my swift-speeding seat and the pure air, the pathway of birds and draw near to this rugged ground; for I want to hear the whole story of your sorrows. I have come to the end of a long journey in my passage to you, Prometheus, guiding by my own will, without a bridle, this swift-winged bird. For your fate, you may be sure, I feel compassion.  Kinship,  I think, constrains me to this; and,  apart from blood ties, there is none to whom I should  pay greater respect than to you. You shall know this for simple truth and that it is not in me to utter vain and empty words; come, tell me; what aid can I render you?  For you shall never say that you have a friend more loyal than Oceanus. Ha!  What have we here?  So then you too have come to stare upon my sufferings?  How did you summon courage to quit the stream that bears your name and the rock-roofed caves you yourself have made and come to this land, the mother of iron? Is it that you have come to gaze upon my state and join your grief to my distress?  Look upon me here—a spectacle, the friend of Zeus, who helped him to establish his sovereign power, by what anguish I am bent by him! I see, Prometheus; and I want to give you the best advice, although you yourself are wily.  Learn to know yourself and adapt  yourself to new ways; for new also is the ruler among the gods. If you hurl forth words so harsh and of such whetted edge, perhaps Zeus may hear you, though throned far off, high in the heavens, and then your present multitude of sorrows shall seem but childish sport.  Oh wretched sufferer!  Put away your wrathful mood and try to find release from these miseries.  Perhaps this advice may seem to you old and dull; but your plight, Prometheus, is only the wages of too boastful speech.  You still have not learned humility, nor do you bend before misfortune, but would rather add even more miseries to those you have.  Therefore take me as your teacher and do not add insult to injury, seeing that a harsh monarch now rules who is accountable to no one.  So now I will depart and see whether I can release you from these sufferings. And may you hold your peace and be not too blustering of speech. Or, can it be that for all your exceeding wisdom, you do not know that chastisement is inflicted on a wagging tongue? I envy you because you have escaped blame for having dared to share with me in my troubles. Do what you want, you cannot persuade him; for he is not easy to persuade.  Beware that you do not do yourself harm by the mission you take. In truth, you are far better able to admonish others than yourself.  It is by fact, not by hearsay, that I judge. So do not hold back one who is eager to go.  For I am confident, yes, confident, that Zeus will grant me this favor, to free you from your sufferings. I thank you for all this and shall never cease to thank you; in zeal you lack nothing, but do not trouble yourself; for your trouble will be vain and not helpful to me—if indeed you want to take the pain.  No, keep quiet and keep yourself clear of harm.  For even if I am in sore plight, I would not wish affliction on everyone else.  No, certainly, no! since, besides, I am distressed by the fate of my brother Atlas, who, towards the west, stands bearing on his shoulders the pillar of heaven and earth, a burden not easy for his arms to grasp.  Pity moved me, too, at the sight of the earth-born dweller of the Cilician caves curbed by violence, that destructive monster of a hundred heads, impetuous Typhon.  He withstood all the gods, hissing out terror with horrid jaws, while from his eyes lightened a hideous glare, as though he would storm by force the sovereignty of Zeus. But the unsleeping bolt of Zeus came upon him, the swooping lightning brand with breath of flame, which struck him, frightened, from his loud-mouthed boasts; then, stricken to the very heart, he was burnt to ashes and his strength blasted from him by the lightning bolt. And now, a helpless and a sprawling bulk, he lies hard by the narrows of the sea, pressed down beneath the roots of rivers of fire, But you are not inexperienced, and do not need me to teach you.  Save yourself, as you know best; while I exhaust my present lot until the time comes when the mind of Zeus shall abandon its wrath. Do you not know then, Prometheus, that words are the physicians of a disordered temper? If one softens the soul in season, and does not hasten to reduce its swelling rage by violence. What lurking mischief do you see when daring joins to zeal?  Teach me this. Lost labor and thoughtless simplicity. Leave me to be affected by this, since it is most advantageous, when truly wise, to be deemed a fool. This fault will be seen to be my own. Clearly the manner of your speech orders me back home. So that you won’t win enmity for yourself by lamenting for me. In the eyes of the one who is newly seated on his omnipotent throne? Beware lest the time come when his heart is angered with you. Your plight, Prometheus, is my instructor. Go away, depart, keep your present purpose. Your urging meets my eagerness; for my four-footed winged beast fans with his wings the smooth pathway of the air; and truly he will be glad to rest his knees in his stall at home. I mourn your unfortunate fate, Prometheus. Shedding from my eyes a coursing flood of tears I wet my tender cheeks with their moist streams.  For Zeus, holding this unenviable power by self-appointed laws, displays towards the gods of old an overweening spirit. Now the whole earth cries aloud in lamentation; . . . lament the greatness of the glory of your time-hallowed honor, the honor that was yours and your brother’s; and all mortals who make their dwelling place in holy And those who dwell in the land of And the warlike flower of The waves of the sea utter a cry as they fall, the deep laments, the black abyss of Hades rumbles in response, and the streams of pure-flowing rivers lament your piteous pain. No, do not think it is from pride or even from wilfulness that I am silent.  Painful thoughts devour my heart as I behold myself maltreated in this way.  And yet who else but I definitely assigned their prerogatives to these upstart gods?  But I do not speak of this; for my tale would tell you nothing except what you know.  Still, listen to the miseries that beset mankind—how they were witless before and I made them have sense and endowed them with reason. I will not speak to upbraid mankind  but to set forth the friendly purpose that inspired my blessing. without purpose they wrought all things in confusion. They had neither knowledge of houses built of bricks and turned to face the sun nor yet of work in wood; but dwelt beneath the ground like swarming ants, in sunless caves.  They had no sign either of winter or of flowery spring or of fruitful summer, on which they could depend but managed everything without judgment, until I taught them to discern the risings of the stars and their settings, which are difficult to distinguish. I invented for them, and the combining of letters, creative mother of the Muses’ arts, with which to hold all things in memory.  I, too, first brought brute beasts beneath the yoke to be subject to the collar and the pack-saddle, so that they might bear in men’s stead their heaviest burdens; and  to the chariot I harnessed horses and made them obedient to the rein, to be an image of wealth and luxury. It was I and no one else who invented the mariner’s flaxen-winged car that roams the sea. for mankind, yet have myself no cunning means to rid me of my present suffering. You have suffered sorrow and humiliation.  You have lost your wits and have gone astray; and, like an unskilled doctor, fallen ill, you lose heart and cannot discover by which remedies to cure your own disease. Hear the rest and you shall wonder the more at the arts and resources I devised.  This first and foremost:  if ever man fell ill, there was no defence—no healing food, no ointment, nor any drink—but for lack of medicine they wasted away, until I showed them how to mix soothing remedies with which they now ward off all their disorders.  And I marked out many ways by which they might read the future, and among dreams I first discerned which are destined to come true; and voices baffling interpretation I explained to them, and signs from chance meetings.  The flight of crook-taloned birds I distinguished clearly— which by nature are auspicious, which sinister—their various modes of life, their mutual feuds and loves, and their consortings; and the smoothness of their entrails, and what color the gall must have to please the gods, also the speckled symmetry of the liver-lobe; and the thigh-bones, wrapped in fat, and the long chine I burned and initiated mankind into an occult art.  Also I cleared their vision to discern signs from flames,which were obscure before this. Enough about these arts.  Now as to the benefits to men that lay concealed beneath the earth—bronze, iron, silver, and gold—who would claim to have discovered them before me?  No one, I know full well, unless he likes to babble idly. Hear the sum of the whole matter in the compass of one brief word—every art possessed by man comes from Prometheus. Do not benefit mortals beyond reason and disregard your own distress; although, I am confident that you will be freed from these bonds and will have power in no way inferior to Zeus. Not in this way is Fate, who brings all to fulfillment, destined to complete this course.  Only when I have been bent by pangs and tortures infinite am I to escape my bondage.  Skill is weaker by far than Necessity. Who then is the helmsman of Necessity? The three-shaped Fates and mindful Furies. Can it be that Zeus has less power than they do? Yes, in that even he cannot escape what is foretold. Why, what is fated for Zeus except to hold eternal sway? This you must not learn yet; do not be over-eager. It is some solemn secret, surely, that you enshroud in mystery. Think of some other subject, for it is not the proper time to speak of this.  No matter what, this must be kept concealed; for it is by safeguarding it that I am to escape my dishonorable bonds and outrage. May Zeus, who apportions everything, never set his power in conflict with my will, nor may I be slow to approach the gods, with holy sacrifices of oxen slain, by the side of the ceaseless stream of Oceanus, my father; and may I not offend in speech; but may this rule abide in my heart and never fade away. Sweet it is to pass all the length of life amid confident hopes, feeding the heart in glad festivities.  But I shudder as I look on you, racked by infinite tortures.  You have no fear of Zeus, Prometheus, but in self-will you reverence mortals too much. Come, my friend, how mutual was your reciprocity?  Tell me, what kind of help is there in creatures of a day?  What aid?  Did you not see the helpless infirmity, no better than a dream, in which the blind generation of men is shackled? Never shall the counsels of mortal men transgress the ordering of Zeus. I have learned this lesson from observing the luck, Prometheus, that has brought about your ruin.  And the difference in the song stole into my thought —this song and that, which, about your bridal bed and bath, I raised to grace your marriage, when you wooed with gifts and won my sister Hesione to be your wedded wife. What land is this?  What people?  By what name am I to call the one I see exposed to the tempest in bonds of rock?  What offence have you committed that as punishment you are doomed to destruction? Tell me to what region of the earth I have wandered in my wretchedness? The waxen pipe drones forth in accompaniment a clear-sounding slumberous strain. Alas, alas! Where is my far-roaming wandering course taking me?  In what, O son of Cronus, in what have you found offence so that you have bound me to this yoke of misery—aah! are you harassing a wretched maiden to frenzy by this terror of the pursuing gadfly?  Consume me with fire, or hide me in the earth, or give me to the monsters of the deep to devour; but do not grudge, O Lord, the favor that I pray for. My far-roaming wanderings have taught me enough, and I cannot discern how to escape my sufferings. Do you hear the voice of the horned virgin? How can I fail to hear the maiden frenzied by the gadfly, the daughter of Inachus?  It is she who fires the heart of Zeus with passion, and now, through Hera’s hate, is disciplined by force with interminable wandering. Why do you call my father’s name? Tell me, the unfortunate maid, who you are, unhappy wretch, that you thus correctly address the miserable maiden, and have named the heaven-sent plague that wastes and stings me with its maddening goad.  Ah me!  In frenzied bounds I come, driven by torturing hunger, victim of Hera’s vengeful purpose.  Who of the company of the unfortunate endures—aah! aah!—sufferings such as mine?  Oh make it clear to me what misery I am fated to suffer,  what remedy is there, what cure, for my affliction.  Reveal it, if you have the knowledge.  Oh speak, declare it to the unfortunate, wandering virgin. I will tell you plainly all that you would like to know, not weaving riddles, but in simple language, since it is right to speak openly to friends.  Look, I whom you see am Prometheus, who gave fire to mankind. O you who have shown yourself a common benefactor of mankind, wretched Prometheus, why do you suffer so? I have only just now finished lamenting my own calamities. You will not then do this favor for me? Say what it is you wish; for you can  learn all from me. Tell me who has bound you fast in this ravine. Zeus by his will, Hephaestus by his hand. And for what offence do you pay the penalty? It suffices that I have made clear to you this much and no more. No, also tell me the end of my wandering—what time is set for wretched me. It would be better not to know than to know, in your case. I beg you, do not hide from me what I am doomed to suffer. No,  it is not that I do not want to grant your request. Why then your reluctance to tell me everything? I am not unwilling; but I hesitate to crush your spirit. Do not be more kind to me than I myself desire. Since you insist, I must speak. Listen, then. No, not yet.  Grant us too a portion of the pleasure.  Let us first inquire the story of her affliction and let her with her own lips relate the events that brought horrid calamity upon her.  Then let her be instructed by you as to the toils still to come. It is for you, Io, to grant them this favor, especially since they are your father’s sisters.  For it is worthwhile to indulge in weeping and in wailing over evil fortunes when one is likely to win the tribute of a tear from the listener. I do not know how to refuse you.  You shall learn in truthful speech all that you would like to know. Yet I am ashamed to tell about the storm of calamity sent by Heaven, of the marring of my form, and of the source from which it swooped upon me, wretched that I am. For visions of the night, always haunting my maiden chamber, sought to beguile me with seductive words, saying: By such dreams was I, to my distress, beset night after night, until at last I gained courage to tell my father of the dreams that haunted me.  And he sent many a messenger to what deed or word of his would find favor with the gods.  But they returned with report of oracles, riddling, obscure, and darkly worded.  Then at last there came an unmistakable utterance to Inachus, charging and commanding him clearly that he must thrust me forth from home and native land to roam at large to the remotest confines of the earth; and, if he would not, a fiery thunderbolt would come from Zeus that would utterly destroy his whole race. he drove me away and barred me from his house, against his will and mine; but the constraint of Zeus forced him to act by necessity.  Immediately my form and mind were distorted, and with horns, as you see, upon my forehead, stung by a sharp-fanged gadfly I rushed with frantic bounds to Cerchnea’s sweet stream and A sudden death robbed him of life unexpectedly; while I, still tormented by the gadfly, am driven on from land to land before the heaven-sent plague. to soothe me with untrue words ; for I consider false words to be the foulest sickness. Oh, ah, go away, alas!  Never, oh never, did I dream that words so strange would greet my ears; or that sufferings so grievous to look upon, yes,  and so grievous to endure, a tale of outrage, would strike my soul as if with double-pronged goad.  Alas, O Fate, O Fate, I shudder to behold the plight that has befallen Io. You lament and are full of fear all too soon. Wait until you have learned the rest as well. Proceed, tell all.  It is comforting for the sick to know clearly beforehand what pain still awaits them. You gained your former request easily from me; for you first desired the story of her ordeal from her own lips.  Hear now the sequel, the sufferings this maid is fated to endure at Hera’s hand. And may you, daughter of Inachus, lay to heart my words so that you may learn the end of your wanderings.\\n               First, from this spot, turn yourself toward the rising sun and make your way over untilled plains; and you shall reach the Scythian nomads, who dwell in thatched houses, perched aloft on strong-wheeled wagons and are equipped with far-darting bows. Do not approach them, but keeping your feet near the rugged shore, where the sea breaks with a roar, pass on beyond their land.  On the left hand dwell the workers in iron, the Chalybes, and you must beware of them, since they are savage and are not to be approached by strangers.  Then you shall reach the river Hybristes, loftiest of mountains, where from its very brows the river pours out its might in fury.  You must pass over its crests, which neighbor the stars, and enter upon a southward course, where you shall reach the host of the Amazons, who loathe all men.  They shall in time to come inhabit Themiscyra on the Thermodon, where, fronting the sea, is Salmydessus’ rugged jaw, evil host of mariners, step-mother of ships.  The Amazons will gladly guide you on your way.  Next, just at the narrow portals of the harbor, you shall reach the Cimmerian isthmus. This you must leave with stout heart and pass through the channel of Maeotis; and ever after among mankind there shall be great mention of your passing, and it shall be called after you the you shall come to the Asian continent. for your hand.  As to the tale you now have heard— understand that it has not even passed the introduction. Ah me, ah me, alas! What!  You are crying and groaning again?  What will you do, I wonder, when you have learned the sufferings still in store for you? What!  Can it be that you have sufferings still left to recount to her? Yes, a tempestuous sea of calamitous distress. What gain have I then in life?  Why did I not hurl myself straightaway from this rugged rock, so that I was dashed to earth and freed from all my sufferings?  It is better to die once and for all than linger out all my days in misery. Ah, you would hardly bear my agonies to whom it is not foredoomed to die; for death would have freed me from my sufferings. But now no limit to my tribulations has been appointed until Zeus is hurled from his sovereignty. What!  Shall Zeus one day be hurled from his dominion? You would rejoice, I think, to see that happen. Why not, since it is at the hand of Zeus that I suffer? Then you may assure yourself that these things are true. By whom shall he be despoiled of the sceptre of his sovereignty? By himself and his own empty-headed purposes. In what way?  Oh tell me, if there be no harm in telling. He shall make a marriage that shall one day cause him distress. With a divinity or with a mortal?  If it may be told, speak out. Why ask with whom?  I may not speak of this. Is it by his consort that he shall be dethroned? Yes, since she shall bear a son mightier than his father. And has he no means to avert this doom? No, none—except me, if I were released from bondage. Who then is to release you against the will of Zeus? It is to be one of your own grandchildren. What did you say?  A child of mine will release you from your misery? The third in descent after ten generations. Your prophecy is not easy to understand. Yes, so do not seek to learn the full extent of your own sufferings. Do not offer me a favor and then withdraw it. I will present you with one or other of two tales. Which two?  Set them forth and offer me the choice. I am making the offer: choose whether I shall reveal the sufferings still in store for you or the one who will be my deliverer. Consent to bestow on her one of these favors, and on me the other; do not deny me the tale.  Tell her about her further wanderings; tell me who will deliver you—for I would like to know this. Well, since you are bent on this, I will not refuse to proclaim all that you still crave to know.  First, to you, Io, will I declare your much-vexed wandering, and may you engrave it on the recording tablets of your mind. When you have crossed the stream that bounds the two continents, toward the flaming east, where the sun walks,......\\n               crossing the surging sea until you reach the Gorgonean plains of Cisthene, where  the daughters of Phorcys dwell, ancient maids, three in number, shaped like swans, possessing one eye amongst them and a single tooth; neither does the sun with his beams look down upon them, nor ever the nightly moon.  And near them are their three winged sisters, the snake-haired Gorgons, loathed of mankind, whom no one of mortal kind shall look upon and still draw breath.  Such is the peril that I bid you to guard against.  But now listen to another and a fearsome spectacle.  Beware of the sharp-beaked hounds of Zeus that do not bark, the gryphons, and the one-eyed Arimaspian folk, mounted on horses, who dwell about the flood of Pluto’s Follow along its banks until you reach the cataract, where, from the Bybline mountains, O Io, and for your children to found your far-off colony. If there is anything still remaining or passed over of her direful wandering that you have to tell, oh speak.  But if you have told all, grant us in turn the favor we request—you probably have it still in memory. She has now heard the full end of her travels; yet so she may know that she has heard no vain tale from me, I will describe the toils she has endured before she came here, giving this as a sure proof of my account. and the sheer ridge that encircles bride-to-be of Zeus (is any of this pleasing to you?), then, stung by the gadfly, you rushed along the pathway by the shore to the great gulf of Rhea, from where you are tossed in backward-wandering course; and for all time to come a recess of the sea, be well assured, shall bear the name Ionian, as a memorial of your crossing for all mankind. returning to the track of my former tale. There is a city, And you shall bring forth dark Epaphus, free choice, but fleeing marriage with their cousin kin; while these, their hearts ablaze with passion, like falcons eagerly pursuing doves, shall come in pursuit of wedlock unlawful to pursue; but God shall grudge them enjoyment of their brides. Pelasgian soil shall offer the maids a home, when, in the watches of the night, their husbands have been slain by a deed of daring wrought by the women’s murderous blows.  For each bride shall take the life of her lord, dyeing a two-edged sword in his blood—in such ways may Love come upon my enemies! However, love’s desire shall charm one of the maidens not to slay her mate; rather, her resolve will lose its edge; for she will make her choice between two evil names to be called coward rather than murderess.  She it is who shall give birth in a long story is necessary to explain this clearly; of her seed, however, shall be born a man of daring, renowned with the bow, who shall deliver me from these toils. The manner and the means—these need lengthy speech to tell, and to learn them all would not be of any benefit. Oh! Oh! Alas! Once again convulsive pain and frenzy, striking my brain, inflame me.  I am stung by the gadfly’s barb, unforged by fire.  My heart knocks at my ribs in terror; my eyeballs roll wildly round and round.  I am carried out of my course by a fierce blast of madness; I’ve lost all mastery over my tongue, and a stream of turbid words beats recklessly against the billows of dark destruction. Ah, sage, sage indeed, was he who first pondered this truth in his mind and with his tongue gave it utterance— that to marry in one’s own class is far the best—a poor man should not desire to marry among those who are pampered by riches, or who are mighty in pride of birth. Never, oh never, immortal Fates, may you see me the partner of the bed of Zeus,  and may I be wedded to no bridegroom who descends to me from heaven. For I shudder when I behold the loveless maidenhood of Io, cruelly crushed like this by her toilsome wanderings sent by Hera. When marriage is on equal terms, in my opinion it is no cause for dread; so never may the love of the mightier gods cast on me its irresistible glance. That would indeed be a war that cannot be fought, a source of resourceless misery; and I do not know what would be my fate, for I do not see how I could escape the designs of Zeus. Yes, truly, the day will come when Zeus, although stubborn of soul, shall be humbled, seeing that he plans a marriage that shall hurl him into oblivion from his sovereignty and throne; and then immediately the curse his father Cronus invoked as he fell from his ancient throne, shall be fulfilled to the uttermost.  Deliverance from such ruin no one of the gods can show him clearly except me. I know the fact and the means.  So let him sit there in his assurance, putting his trust in the crash reverberating on high and brandishing his fire-breathing bolt in his hands.  For these shall not protect him  from falling in ignominious and unendurable ruin. Such an adversary is he now preparing despite himself, a prodigy irresistible, even one who shall discover a flame mightier than the lightning and a deafening crash to outroar the thunder; a prodigy who shall shiver the trident, Poseidon’s spear, that scourge of the sea and shaker of the land. Surely, it is only your own desire that you utter as a curse against Zeus. I speak what shall be brought to pass and, moreover, my own desire. Must we really look for one to gain mastery over Zeus? Yes, and he shall bear upon his neck pangs more galling than these of mine. How is it that you are not afraid to utter such taunts? Why should I fear since I am fated not to die? But he might inflict on you an ordeal even more bitter than this. Let him, for all I care!  I am prepared for anything. Wise are they who do homage to Necessity. Worship, adore, and fawn upon whoever is your lord.  But for Zeus I care less than nothing.  Let him do his will, let him hold his power for his little day— since he will not bear sway over the gods for long. But wait, for over there I see his messenger, the servant of our new lord and master.  Certainly he has come to announce some news. To you, the clever and crafty, bitter beyond all bitterness, who has sinned against the gods in bestowing honors upon creatures of a day—to you, thief of fire, I speak.  The Father commands that you tell what marriage you boast of, whereby he is to be hurled from power—and this, mark well, set forth in no riddling fashion, but point by point, as the case exactly stands; and do not impose upon me a double journey, Prometheus—you see Zeus is not appeased by dealings such as yours. Bravely spoken, in truth, and swollen with pride is your speech, as befits a minion of the gods. Young you are, as young your power, and you think indeed that you inhabit heights beyond the reach of grief.  Have I not seen two sovereigns cast out from these heights?  A third, the present lord, I shall live to see  cast out in ruin most shameful and most swift.  Do you think I quail, perhaps, and cower before these upstart gods?  Far from it—no, not at all.  But scurry  back the way you came; for you shall learn nothing about which you question me. Yet it was by such proud wilfulness before, too, that you brought yourself to this harbor of distress. For your servitude, rest assured, I’d  not barter my hard lot, not I. Better, no doubt, to serve this rock than be the trusted messenger of Father Zeus! Such is the proper style for the insolent to offer insult. I think you revel in your present plight. I revel?  Oh, I wish that I might see my enemies revelling in this way!  And you, too, I count among them. What!  You blame me in some way for your calamities? In one word, I hate all the gods that received good at my hands and with ill requite me wrongfully. Your words declare you stricken with no slight madness. Mad I may be—if it is madness to loathe one’s enemies. You would be unbearable if you were prosperous. Alas! But ever-ageing Time teaches all things. Yes, but you at least have not yet learned to keep a sober mind. Or else I would not have addressed you, an underling. It seems you will answer nothing that the Father demands. Yes, truly, I am his debtor and I should repay favor to him. You taunt  me as though, indeed, I were a child. And are you not a child and even more witless than a child if you expect to learn anything from me? There is no torment or device by which Zeus shall induce me to utter this until these injurious fetters are loosed.  So then, let his blazing lightning be hurled, and with the white wings of the snow and thunders of earthquake let him confound the reeling world. For nothing of this shall bend my will even to tell at whose hands he is fated to be hurled from his sovereignty. Look  now whether this course seems to profit you. Long ago has this my course been foreseen and resolved. Bend your will, perverse fool, oh bend your will at last to wisdom in face of your present sufferings. In vain you trouble me, as though it were a wave you try to persuade.  Never think that, through terror at the will of Zeus, I shall become womanish and, with hands upturned, aping woman’s ways, shall importune my greatly hated enemy to release me from these bonds.  I am far, far from that. I think that by speaking much I will only speak in vain; for you are not soothed nor are you softened by my entreaties.  You take the bit in your teeth like a new-harnessed colt and struggle against the reins.  Yet it is a paltry device that prompts your vehemence, for in the foolish-minded mere self-will of itself avails less than anything at all.  But if you will not be won to belief by my words, think of what a tempest and a towering wave of woe shall break upon you past escape.  First, the Father will shatter this jagged cliff with thunder and lightning-flame, and will entomb your frame, while the rock shall still hold you clasped in its embrace. But when you have completed a long stretch of time, you shall come back again to the light.  Then indeed the winged hound of Zeus, the ravening eagle, coming an unbidden banqueter the whole day long, with savage appetite shall tear your body piecemeal into great rents and feast his fill upon your liver until it is black with gnawing. Therefore be advised, since this is no counterfeited vaunting but utter truth; for the mouth of Zeus does not know how to utter falsehood, but will bring to pass every word.  May you consider warily and reflect, and never deem stubbornness better than wise counsel. To us, at least, Hermes seems not to speak untimely; for he bids you to  lay aside your stubbornness and seek the good counsel of wisdom.  Be advised! It is shameful for the wise to persist in error. No news to me, in truth, is the message this fellow has proclaimed so noisily.Yet for enemy to suffer ill from enemy is no disgrace.  Therefore let the lightning’s forked curl be cast upon my head and let the sky be convulsed with thunder and the wrack of savage winds; let the hurricane shake the earth from its rooted base, and let the waves of the sea mingle with their savage surge the courses of the stars in heaven; and let him lift me on high and hurl me down to black Tartarus with the swirling floods of stern Necessity: do what he will, me he shall never bring to death. Such indeed are the thoughts and the words one hears from men deranged.  Where does his prayer fall short of raving?  Where does he abate his frenzy?—But, at all events, may you who sympathize with his anguish, withdraw in haste from this spot so that  the relentless roar of the thunder does not stun your senses. Use some other strain and urge me to some other course in which you are likely to convince me. This utterance in your flood of speech is, I think, past all endurance.  How do you charge me to practise baseness?  With him I am content to suffer any fate; for I have learned to detest traitors, and there is no pest I abhor more than this. Well then, bear my warning in memory and do not blame your fortune when you are caught in the toils of calamity; nor ever say that it was Zeus who cast you into suffering unforeseen.  Not so, but blame yourselves.  For well forewarned, and not suddenly or secretly shall you be entangled in the inextricable net of calamity by reason of your folly. Indeed, now it has passed from word to deed—the earth rocks, the echoing thunder-peal from the depths rolls roaring past me; the fiery wreathed lightning-flashes flare forth, and whirlwinds toss the swirling dust; the blasts of all the winds leap forth and set in hostile array their embattled strife; the sky is confounded with the deep.  Behold, this stormy turmoil advances against me visibly, sent by Zeus to frighten me.  O holy mother mine, O you firmament that  revolves the common light of all, you see the wrongs I suffer!  \n",

                               On to the Prince’s quarters!—Ho! Who is awake? What man-at-arms, Or squire or groom?—Let Hector know New rumour of alarms From sentinels who stand at mark The four long watches of the dark, While others sleep.—Uplift thine head, O Hector! On thine elbow rise, Unhood the eagle of thine eyes, Up from thy leaf-strewn bed!— Lord Hector! Who goes there? Who cries? A friend? The watchword! . . . By what right Do men come prowling in the night Across my quarters? Come! Speak out. A picket, Lord. In such a rout? Be not afraid, Lord. I am not. Is there an ambush? No? Then what, In God’s name, brings you from your post With no clear tale to speak, To spread this turmoil through a host That lies in harness—do ye all Know nothing?—out against the wall And gateways of the Greek? To arms! To arms, Lord Hector!—Send First where the allied armies lie, Bid them draw sword and make an end Of sleep.—Let someone fly And get the horses’ armour on!— Who goes with me to Panthoös’ son?— Who’s for Sarpêdon and the Lycians?—None Hath seen the priest Ho, Captain of the Runners, ho!— Ho, Trojans of the hornèd bow! String, string! For need is nigh. Ha, silence there! . . . First words of fear, Then comfort. All an empty swell! It seems The lash of trembling Pan Hath caught you. Speak, if speak ye can. What tidings? Not a word is clear Of the whole tale ye tell. Great beacons in the Have burned, my chief, through half the night. The shipyard timbers Then, clear against the light, Toward Agamemnon’s tent the whole Army in tumult seemed to roll, As stirred by some strange voice, shoal after shoal. A night of such discord Was never seen. And we, in dread What such things boded, turned and sped Hither; dost blame us, Lord? No! Welcome, friend, with all thy tale of fear! It shows they mean to fly: they mean to clear Decks in the dark and so delude my sight . . . I like that beacon-burning in the night. O Zeus above, who checked my conquering way, Who baulked the hungry lion of his prey Or ever I could sweep my country clear Of these despoilers, dost thou hate my spear? Had but the sun’s bright arrows failed me not, I ne’er had rested till the ships were hot With fire, and through the tents upon the plain This bloody hand had passed and passed again! Myself, I longed to try the battle-cast By night, and use God’s vantage to the last, But sage and prophet, learned in the way Of seercraft, bade me wait for dawn of day, And then—leave no Greek living in the land. They wait not, they, for what my prophets planned So sagely. In the dark a runaway Beats a pursuer. Through our whole array Send runners! Bid them shake off sleep and wait Ready with shield and spear. ’Tis not too late To catch them as they climb on board, and slash Their crouching shoulders till the gangways splash With blood, or teach them, fettered leg and arm, To dig the stiff clods of some Trojan farm. My Prince, thy words run fast. Nor thou nor I Have knowledge yet that the Greeks mean to fly. What makes them light their beacons? Tell me, what? God knows! And, for my part, I like it not. What, feared? Thou wouldst be feared of everything! They never lit such light before, O King. They never fled, man, in such wild dismay. ’Twas all thy work.—Judge thou, and we obey. My word is simple. Arm and face the foe. Who comes? Aeneas, and in haste, as though Fraught with some sudden tiding of the night. Hector, what means it? Watchers in affright Who gather shouting at thy doors, and then Hold midnight council, shaking all our men? To arms, Aeneas! Arm from head to heel! What is it? Tidings? Doth the Some march, some ambush in the day’s eclipse? ’Tis flight, man! They are marching to the ships. How know’st thou?—Have we proof that it is flight? They are burning beacon-fires the livelong night. They never mean to wait till dawn. Behind That screen of light they are climbing in the blind Dark to their ships—unmooring from our coast. God guide them!—Why then do you arm the host? I mean to lame them in their climbing, I And my good spear, and break them as they fly. Black shame it were, and folly worse than shame, To let these spoilers go the road they came Unpunished, when God gives them to us here. Brother, I would thy wit were like thy spear! But Nature wills not one man should be wise In all things; each must seek his separate prize. And thine is battle pure. There comes this word Of beacons, on the touch thy soul is stirred: Past stake and trench, while night hangs like a pall! Say, when we cross that coiling depth of dyke, We find the foe not fled, but turned to strike; One check there, and all hope of good return Is gone. How can our men, returning, learn The tricks of the palisade? The chariots how Keep to the bridges on the trenches’ brow, Save with jammed wheels and broken axles? Aye, And say thou conquer: other wars yet lie Before thee. Peleus’ son, for all his ire, Will never let thee touch the ships with fire Or pounce on his Greek lambs. The man will bide No wrong and standeth on a tower of pride. Nay, brother, let the army, head on shield, Sleep off its long day’s labour in the field: Then, send a spy; find someone who will dare Creep to yon They mean flight, on and smite them as they fly. Else, if the beacons hide some strategy, The spy will read it out, and we can call A council.—Thus speak I, my general. ’Tis good! ’Tis wisdom! Prince, give heed And change the word thy passion gave. No soldier loveth, in his need, The glory of a chief too brave. A spy is best: a spy, to learn For what strange work those beacons burn All night beside the guarded wave. Ye all so wish it?—Well, ye conquer me.  Some stir among them, hearing of these high And midnight councils.—I will seek the spy To send to the Greek camp. If there we learn Of some plot hatching, on the man’s return I straight will call thee and share counsels. So. But wait attentive. If he says they go Shipward and plan to escape, one trumpet call Shall warn thee, and I wait no more, but fall On camp and hulls, or ever dawn can rise. Aye, haste and send him. Now thy plans are wise, And when need comes I am with thee, sword by sword. Ye gathered Trojans, sharers of my word, Who dares to creep through the Greek lines alone? Who will so help his fatherland? Doth none Offer? Must I do everything, one hand Alone, to save our allies and our land? I, Prince!—I offer for our City’s sake To go disguised to the Greek ships, to make Their counsels mine, and here bring word to thee. If that be thy full service, I agree. Dolon the Wolf! A wise wolf and a true! Thy father’s house was praised when first I knew ’Tis wise to do good work, but also wise To pay the worker. Aye, and fair reward Makes twofold pleasure, though the work be hard. So be it: an honest rule. Do thou lay down What guerdon likes thee best—short of my crown. I care not for thy crowned and care-fraught life. Wouldst have a daughter of the King to wife? I seek no mate that might look down on me. Good gold is ready, if that tempteth thee. We live at ease and have no care for gold. Well, Pay me not now, but when the Greeks are ta’en. The Greeks! . . . Choose any save the Atridae twain. Kill both, an it please thee. I make prayer for none. Thou wilt not ask for Ajax, Ileus’ son A princely hand is skilless at the plough. ’Tis ransom, then? . . . What prisoner cravest thou? I said before, of gold we have our fill. For spoils and armour . . . thou shalt choose at will. Nail them for trophies on some temple wall. What seeks the man? What prize more rich than all? Achilles’ horses! Yes, I need a great Prize. I am dicing for my life with Fate. ’Fore God, I am thy rival, if thy love Lies there. Undying was the breed thereof, And these shall never die, who bear to war Great Peleus’ son, swift gleaming like a star. Poseidon, rider of the wild sea-drift, Tamed them, men say, and gave them for his gift To Peleus.—None the less, since I have stirred Hopes, I will baulk them not. I pledge my word, Achilles’ steeds, a rare prize, shall be thine. I thank thee.—’Tis indeed a prize more fine Than all in Grudge me not that; there be Guerdons abundant for a Prince like thee. O peril strange, O fearful prize! Yet win it and thy life hath wings: A deed of glory in men’s eyes, A greatness, to be wooed of kings. If God but hearken to the right, Thou drinkest to the full this night The cup of man’s imaginings. There lies the way.—But first I must go find At home some body-shelter to my mind; Then, forward to the ships of What other raiment wilt thou need than this? A garb for work, for night; a thieving guise. ’Tis good to learn the wisdoms of the wise. What will thy wrapping be? A grey wolf’s hide Shall wrap my body close on either side; My head shall be the mask of gleaming teeth, My arms fit in the forepaws, like a sheath, My thighs in the hinder parts. No Greek shall tell ’Tis not a wolf that walks, half visible, On four feet by the trenches and around The ship-screen. When it comes to empty ground It stands on two.—That is the plan, my friend! Now Maian Hermes guide thee to thy end And home safe! Well he loves all counterfeit . . . Good work is there; may good luck go with it! There, and then back! . . . And on this belt shall bleed Odysseus’ head—or why not Diomede?— To prove my truth. Ere dawn can touch the land I shall be here, and blood upon my hand. Thymbraean, Delian, Birth divine, That walkest Lycia’s inmost shrine, Come, strong to guard, to guide, to follow, Come, bow in hand and girt with night, To help thy Dardans as of old, When stone by stone thy music rolled— O conquering Strength, O Sire Apollo!— Young Grant that he reach the shipyard, creep Keen-eyed through all that host asleep, Then back to home and hearth, yet living, Where now his father prays alone: Yea, grant that, when the Greeks are slain, Our wolf shall mount with scourge and rein Those coursers of the sea-god’s giving, Whom Peleus drove in days foregone. Alone in those Greek ships to stake His life, for home and country’s sake: ’Tis wondrous! Few be hearts so true When seas across the bulwark break, And sunlight sickens o’er the crew. Ah, The Phrygian spear flies fast and far! Where shall ye find the fool to mock Our works in war? Whom will he stab a-sleeping, whom, The quick grey wolf, the crawling doom? Grant that he slay the Spartan! Nay, Or Agamemnon’s head and plume To Helen bear at dawn of day! A lightsome dawn to hear her wail Her brother sworn, her King who came To And swords, and flame! Ho, Master! I would it ofttimes were my luck to share As goodly news with thee as now I bear. What dulness hangs about these shepherds! Block, Com’st thou to us with tidings of thy flock Here in the field in arms? Who wants thee here? Thou know’st my house; thou know’st my father’s. There Tell all about thy lucky lambs.—Now go. Dull wits, we shepherds! Aye, ’twas alway so. Yet still, there is some good news to be told. A truce there to thy gossip of the fold! Our dealings are of war, of sword and spear. Aye; so were mine. That is what brought me here. A chief comes yonder, leading a great band Of spears, with help to thee and all the land. From whence? How do his name and lineage run? He comes from Rhesus! Not Rhesus, here on Trojan soil? Thou hast guessed. That eases me of half my toil. What makes he there towards Ida? All astray Thus from the plain and the broad waggon-way! I know not rightly, though one well may guess. ’Tis hard to land at night, with such a press Of spears, on a strange coast, where rumours tell Of foes through all the plain-land. We that dwell On Ida, in the rock, Troy’s ancient root And hearth-stone, were well frighted, through the mute And wolfish thickets thus to hear him break. A great and rushing noise those Thracians make, Marching. We, all astonied, ran to drive Our sheep to the upmost heights. ’Twas some We thought, who came to sweep the mountain clear And waste thy folds; till suddenly our ear Caught at their speech, and knew ’twas nothing Greek. Then all our terror fled. I ran to seek Some scout or pioneer who led the van And called in Thracian: He told me what I sought, and there I stood Watching; and saw one gleaming like a God, Tall in the darkness on a Thracian car. A plate of red gold mated, like a bar, His coursers’ necks, white, white as fallen snow. A carven targe, with golden shapes aglow, Hung o’er his back. Before each courser’s head A Gorgon, to the frontlet riveted, With bells set round-like stories that they tell Of Pallas’ shield-made music terrible. The numbers of that host no pen could write Nor reckon; ’tis a multitudinous sight, Long lines of horsemen, lines of targeteers, Archers abundant; and behind them veers A wavering horde, light-armed, in Thracian weed. A friend is come to ’Gainst whom no Shall aught avail nor ’scape his conquering hand. Lo, when the Gods breathe gently o’er a town, All runs to good, as water-streams run down. Aye, when my spear hath fortune, when God sends His favour, I shall find abundant friends. I need them not; who never came of yore To help us, when we rolled to death before The war-swell, and the wind had ripped our sail. Then Rhesus taught us Trojans what avail His words are.—He comes early to the feast; Where was he when the hunters met the beast? Where, when we sank beneath the Well may’st thou mock and blame thy friend. Yet here He comes with help for Troy. Accept him thou. We are enough, who have held the wall till now. Master, dost think already that our foe Is ta’en? I do. To-morrow’s light will show. Have care. Fate often flings a backward cast. I hate the help that comes when need is past . . . Howbeit, once come, I bid him welcome here As guest—not war-friend; guest to share our cheer. The thanks are lost, he might have won from us. My general, to reject an ally thus Must needs make hatred. The mere sight of those I saw would sure cast fear upon our foes. Ah, well; thy words are prudent; and See glorious things. With all these panoplies Of gold that filled our Shepherd’s heart with joy, Bid Rhesus welcome, as war-friend to Troy. Now Adrasteia Our lips from sin, lest the end be hard! But he cometh, he cometh, the Child of the River! The pride of my heart it shall roll unbarred. We craved thy coming; yea, need was strong In the Hall of thy lovers, O child of Song; Thy mother the Muse and her fair-bridged River They held thee from us so long, so long! By Strymon’s torrent alone she sang, And Strymon shivered and coiled and sprang; And her arms went wide to the wild sweet water, And the love of the River around her rang. We hail thee, Fruit of the River’s seed, Young Zeus of the Dawn, on thy starry steed! O ancient City, O Ida’s daughter, Is God the Deliverer found indeed? And men shall tell of thee, Once more a-harping at day’s decline, ’Mid laughing of lovers and lays and dances And challenge on challenge of circling wine? When the Greek is smitten that day shall be, And fled to O mighty of hand, O leader of lances, Smite him, and heaven be good to thee! Thou Rider golden and swift and sheer, Achilles falters: appear! appear! The car like flame where the red shield leapeth, The fell white steeds and the burning spear! No Greek shall boast he hath seen thy face And danced again in the dancing place; And the land shall laugh for the sheaves she reapeth, Of spoilers dead by a sword from All hail, great King! A whelp indeed Is born in Whose leap shall make strong cities bleed. Behold his body girt with gold, And hark the pride of bells along The frontlet of that targe’s hold. A God, O Troy, a God and more! ’Tis Ares’ self, this issue strong Of Strymon and the Muse of song, Whose breath is fragrant on thy shore! Lord Hector, Prince of Of noble sires, all hail! Long years have run Since last we greeted, and ’tis joy this day To see thy fortunes firm and thine array Camped at the foe’s gate. Here am I to tame That foe for thee, and wrap his ships in flame. Thou child of Music and the Thracian flood, Strymonian Rhesus, truth is alway good In Hector’s eyes. I wear no double heart. Long, long ago thou shouldst have borne thy part In For all thy help, to sink beneath the spear. Why didst thou—not for lack of need made plain!— Not come, not send, not think of us again? What grave ambassadors prayed not before Thy throne, what herald knelt not at thy door? What pride of gifts did Troy not send to thee? And thou, a lord of Barbary even as we, Thou, brother of our blood, like one at sup Who quaffs his fill and flings away the cup, Hast flung to the Greeks my city! Yet, long since, ’Twas I that found thee but a little prince And made thee mighty, I and this right hand; When round Pangaion and the Paiôn’s land, Front against front, I burst upon the brood Of Their power to thine. The grace whereof, not small, Thou hast spurned, and when thy kinsmen, drowning, call, Comest too late. Thou! Others there have been These long years, not by nature of our kin . . Some under yon rough barrows thou canst see Lie buried; they were true to Troy and me; And others, yet here in the shielded line Or mid the chariots, parching in the shine Of noonday, starving in the winds that bite Through On at my side. ’Twas not their way, to lie On a soft couch and, while the cups go by, Pledge my good health, like thee, in Thracian wine. I speak as a free man. With thee and thine Hector is wroth, and tells thee to thy face. Thy way is mine, friend. Straight I run my race In word and deed, and bear no double tongue. I tell thee, more than thine my heart was wrung, Yea, angered past all durance, thus to stay Back from thy battles. ’Twas a folk that lay Hard on my borders, Scythians of the north; Just when my host for Troy had started forth, They fell upon our homes. I had reached the coast Of the Friendless Sea and purposed to have crossed My Thracians there. We turned; and all that plain Is trampled in a mire of Scythian slain Ploughed by our spears, and blood of Not stinted. This it was that drowned thy call For help and held me back from I broke their power; the princes of their breed I took to hostage, made their elders swear To bring my house due tribute, year by year, Then, never lagging, crossed the Marched by long stages through And here am come . . . not drunken with the feast, As thou wouldst have me be, not lulled to rest In golden chambers. In this harness hard I have borne my nights of winter storm that starred The Euxine into ice and scared the strong Paionians. Long I have been, but not too long To save thee yet. Friend, this is the tenth year Thou labourest on unceasing, with no clear Vantage; day creeps by day, and Ares throws The same red dice for thee and for thy foes. Now, hear my vow. Before one day’s eclipse I swear to break their wall, to burn their ships And slay their princes. On the second day I leave this soil and take my homeward way, Thy pains relieved. No Trojan of the land Need move, nor turn the buckler in his hand. Alone my late-comers will turn the tide And smite your Greeks, for all their bitter pride. All hail! Sweet words and faithful heart! Only may Zeus avert From those proud lips the Wrath that none may bear! Never a galleon bore, Now, nor in days of yore, Prince like to thee, so valiant and so fair. How shall Achilles, how Shall Ajax bear him now, Or face thy lance? May I but stand that day Watching to see him reel Broken beneath thy steel, And once in blood his many murders pay! Yea, more atonement thou shalt take from me For this slow help.—May Adrasteia see My heart and pardon!—When we two have set Troy free from these who compass her with hate, Soon as the Gods have had their first-fruits, I With thee will sail—so help me Zeus on high!— And sack all Doers of deeds shall know what suffering is. By heaven, could I once see this peril rolled Past us, and live in Untrembling, I would thank my gods! To seek ’Twere not such light work as thou fanciest. These Greeks that face thee, are they not their best? We seek not better. These do all we need. When these are beaten, then, we have done the deed. Lose not thy path watching a distant view. Thou seem’st content to suffer, not to do? I have a kingdom large by mine own right .. What station will best please thee in this fight To ground the targe and stablish thine array? Right, left, or midmost in the allies? Say. ’Twould please me best to fight these Greeks alone. Yet, if ’twould irk thine honour not to have thrown One firebrand on the ships with me, why, then Set us to face Achilles and his men. Achilles? Nay, his spear ye cannot meet. How so? Fame said he sailed here with the fleet. He sailed, and he is here. But some despite ’Gainst the great King now keeps him from the fight. Who next to him hath honour in their host? Next, to my seeming, Ajax hath the most, Or Diomede.—But Odysseus is a tough And subtle fox, and brave; aye, brave enough. No man of them hath harmed us more than he. He climbed here to Athena’s sanctuary One night, and stole her image clean away To the Guised as a wandering priest, in rags, he came And walked straight through the Gates, made loud acclaim Of curses on the Greek, spied out alone All that he sought in Gone, and the watch and helpers of the Gate Dead! And in every ambush they have set By the old Altar, close to Troy, we know He sits—a murderous reptile of a foe! No brave man seeks so dastardly to harm His battle-foes; he meets them arm to arm. This Greek of thine, this sitter like a thief In ambush, I will make of him my chief Care. I will take him living, drive a straight Stake through him, and so star him at the Gate To feed your wide-winged vultures. ’Tis the death Most meet for a lewd thief, who pillageth God’s sanctuary, or so we hold in Seek first some sleep. There still remains a space Of darkness.—I will show the spot that best May suit you, somewhat sundered from the rest. Should need arise, the password of the night Is Phoebus: see your Thracians have it right. Advance beyond your stations, men, at some Distance, and stay on watch till Dolon come With word of the Argives’ counsel. If his vow Prosper, he should be nearing us by now. Say, whose is the watch? Who exchanges With us? The first planets to rise Are setting; the Pleiades seven Move low on the margin of heaven, And the Eagle is risen and ranges The mid-vault of the skies. No sleeping yet! Up from your couches And watch on, the sluggards ye are! The moon-maiden’s lamp is yet burning. Oh, the morning is near us, the morning! Even now his fore-runner approaches, Yon dim-shining star. Who drew the first night-watch? ’Twas one Koroibos, called the Mygdon’s Son. And after? The Mount Taurus men Had second watch: from them again The Mysians took it. We came then. ’Tis surely time. Who will go tell The fifth watch? ’Tis the Lycians’ spell By now; ’twas thus the portions fell. Nay, hearken! Again she is crying Where death-laden Simois falls, Of the face of dead Itys that stunned her, Of grief grown to music and wonder: Most changeful and old and undying The nightingale calls. And on Ida the shepherds are waking Their flocks for the upland. I hear The skirl of a pipe very distant. And sleep, it falls slow and insistent. ’Tis perilous sweet when the breaking Of dawn is so near. Why have we still no word nor sign Of that scout in the I know not; he is long delayed. God send he trip not on the blade Of some Greek in an ambuscade! It may be. I am half afraid. Our time is past! Up, men, and tell The fifth watch. ’Tis the Lycians’ spell Now, as the portions fairly fell. Diomede, hist!—A little sound of arms Clanking . . . or am I full of void alarms? No. ’Tis some horse tied to the chariot rail That clanks his chain.—My heart began to fail A moment, till I heard the horse’s champ. Mind—in that shade—the watchers of the camp. I keep in shadow, but I am staring hard. Thou know’st the watchword, if we stir some guard? Phoebus.   ’Twas the last sign that Dolon gave. Now, forward! God! All empty as the grave! Yet Dolon told us Hector’s couch was made Just here. For none but him I drew this blade. What means it? To some ambush is he gone? Maybe, to work some craft on us at dawn. He is hot with courage when he is winning, hot. What must we do, Odysseus?—He was not Laid where we thought him, and our hopes are lost. Back to our own ship-rampart at all cost! The God who gave him victory saves him still. We cannot force Fortune against her will. Could we not find Aeneas? Or the bed Of Paris the accurst, and have his head? Go by night searching through these lines of men For chiefs to kill? ’Twere death and death again. But to go empty back—what shame ’twill be!— And not one blow struck home at the enemy! How not one blow? Did we not baulk and kill Dolon, their spy, and bear his tokens still? Dost think the whole camp should be thine to quell? Good. Now for home! And may the end be well! What make ye, from these sleepers thus to part Desponding and with sorrow-wounded heart If Hector be not granted you to slay Nor Paris? Little know ye what great stay Of help is found for Troy. This very night Rhesus is come; who, if he see the light Of morning, not Achilles nor the rack Of Ajax’ spear hath power to hold him back, Ere wall and gate be shattered and inside Your camp a spear-swept causeway builded wide To where beached galleys flame above the dead. Him slay, and all is won. Let Hector’s head Sleep where it lies and draw unvexèd breath; Another’s work, not thine, is Hector’s death. Most high Athena, well I know the sound Of that immortal voice. ’Tis ever found My helper in great perils.—Where doth lie Rhesus, mid all this host of Barbary? Full near he lies, not mingled with the host Of Troy, but here beyond the lines—a post Of quiet till the dawn, that Hector found. And near him, by his Thracian chariot bound, Two snow-white coursers gleam against the wan Moon, like the white wing of a river swan. Their master slain, take these to thine own hearth, A wondrous spoil; there hides not upon earth A chariot-team of war so swift and fair. Say, Diomede, wilt make the men thy share, Or catch the steeds and leave the fight to me? I take the killing, thou the stablery: It needs keen wit and a neat hand. The post A man should take is where he helpeth most. Behold, ’tis Paris, hasting there toward This tent. Methinks he knoweth from the guard Some noise of prowling Argives hither blown. Comes he alone or with his guards? Alone; Toward Hector’s quarters, as I deem, he plies His message. He hath heard some tale of spies. Then he shall be the first dead Trojan! No; Beyond the ordainèd end thou canst not go. Fate hath not willed that Paris by thy deed Shall die; it is another who must bleed To-night. Therefore be swift! For me, my guise Shall melt and change in Alexander’s eyes, Yea, till he dream ’tis Cypris, his delight And help in need, that meets him in the night, And soft shall be my words to him I hate. So speak I; but on whom my spell is set He hears not, sees not, though so near I stand. Ho, Hector! Brother! General of the land! Sleepest thou still? We need thy waking sight. Our guards have marked some prowler of the night, We know not if a mere thief or a spy. Have comfort thou! Doth not the Cyprian’s eye Mark all thy peril and keep watch above Thy battles? How shall I forget the love I owe thee, and thy faithful offices? To crown this day and all its victories, Lo, I have guided here to Troy a strong Helper, the scion of the Muse of song And Strymon’s flood, the crownèd stream of Indeed thy love is steadfast, and thy grace Bounteous to And jewel of my days, which I to Troy Have brought, and made thee hers.—O Cyprian, I heard, not clearly,—’twas some talk that ran Among the pickets—spies had passed some spot Close by the camp. The men who saw them not Talk much, and they who saw, or might have seen, Can give no sign nor token. It had been My purpose to find Hector where he lay. Fear nothing. All is well in Troy’s array. Hector is gone to help those Thracians sleep. Thy word doth rule me, Goddess. Yea, so deep My trust is, that all thought of fear is lost In comfort, and I turn me to my post. Go. And remember that thy fortunes still Are watched by me, and they who do my will Prosper in all their ways. Aye, thou shalt prove Ere long, if I can care for those I love. Back, back, ye twain! Are ye in love with death? Our golden Thracian gaspeth in his blood; The steeds are ours; the foe hath understood And crowds against you. Haste ye! haste to fly,— Ere yet the lightning falleth, and ye die! Ha! Ha!—At them! At them! After them! Down with them !—Where are they? Who is that fellow? Look! That yonder! Rascal thieves, the sort that crawl And vex an army in the dark! Ho, this way! Follow! This way all! I have them! I have caught them! Whence comest thou?  What art thou?   Say; what captain and what company? ’Tis not for thee to know. This day thou diest for thy knavery! Stop! Give the watchword quick, before I have thy body on my pike. Halt every man and have no fear! Come, gather round. Be quick to strike. ’Twas thou that killed King Rhesus! No: ’tis I that kill the man that killed . . . Hold back all! No more holding back! What, strike an ally in the field? Then give the watchword! Phoebus. Right. Ho, every man hold back his spear!— Then know’st thou where the men are gone? We saw them running, somewhere here. Off every one upon their track! Or should we rouse the army? No; To stir the allies in the night and make more panic! Let us go. Who was the man that passed? Who, that, so madly bold, Even as I held him fast, Laughed, and I loosed my hold? Where shall I find him now? What shall I deem of him, To steal thro’ the guards a-row, Quaking not, eye nor limb, On thro’ the starlight dim? Is he of Born by the Locrian sea, Or harvester of some starved island’s corn? What man hath seen his face? What was his name or race, What the high God This night must be Odysseus’ work, or whose?— Odysseus? Aye, to judge by ancient use.— Odysseus surely!—That is thy belief?— What else? It seems he hath no fear Of such as we!—Whom praise ye there? Whose prowess?   Say!—Odysseus.—Nay, Praise not the secret stabbing of a thief! He came once, of old, Up thro’ the city throng, Foam on his lips, a-cold, Huddled in rags that hung Covering just the sword Hid in his mantle’s pleat; His face grimed and scored, A priest of wandering feet, Who begged his bread in the street. Many and evil things He cast on the brother kings Like one long hurt, who nurseth anger sore; Would that a curse, yea, would The uttermost wrath of God Had held those feet from walking Odysseus or another, ’tis the guard Will weep for this. Aye, Hector will be hard.— What will he say?—He will suspect.—Suspect? What evil? What should make you fear?— ’Twas we that left a passage clear.— A passage?—Yea, for these men’s way, Who came by night into the lines unchecked. Woe, woe! The burden of the wrath of fate! Ha, listen! Wait. Crouch on the ground; it may be yet Our man is drawing to the net. Woe, woe! The burden of the hills of An ally? None of Hellene race. Woe, woe! Yea, woe to me and woe to thee, My master! Once to set thine eye On Ho there! What ally passes? The dim night Blurreth mine eyes; I cannot see thee right. Ho, some one of the Trojan name! Where sleeps your king beneath his shield, Hector? What marshal of the field Will hear our tale . . . the men who came And struck us and were gone; and we, We woke and there was nought to see, But our own misery. I cannot hear him right; it sounds as if The Thracians were surprised or in some grief. The army lost and the king slain, Stabbed in the dark! Ah, pain! pain! This deep raw wound . . . Oh, let me die By thy side, Master, by thy side! In shame together let us lie Who came to save, and failed and died. This needs no surmise: ’tis disaster plain That comes. He speaketh of some ally slain. Disaster, yea: and with disaster shame, Which lights Disaster to a twofold flame Of evil. For to die in soldier’s wise, Since die we needs must . . . though the man who dies Hath pain . . . to all his house ’tis praise and pride; But we, like laggards and like fools we died! When Hector’s hand had showed us where to rest And told the watchword, down we lay, oppressed With weariness of that long march, and slept Just as we fell. No further watch was kept, Our arms not laid beside us; by the horse No yoke nor harness ordered. Hector’s force Had victory, so my master heard, and lay Secure, just waiting for the dawn of day To attack. So thought we all, and our lines broke And slept. After a little time I woke, Thinking about my horses, that the morn Must see them yoked for war. I found the corn And gave them plenteously. Then in the deep Shadow I saw two men who seemed to creep Close by our line, but swiftly, as I stirred, Crouched and were seeking to make off unheard. I shouted then, and bade them keep away: Two thieves, I thought, from the great host that lay Round us. They never answered, and, for me, I said no more but turned and presently Was sleeping. In my sleep there came a dream. I seemed to see the horses—mine own team I had trained long since and drove at Rhesus’ side— But wolves were on their backs, wolves, couched astride, Who drove and scourged; I saw the horses rear And stagger with wide nostrils, stiff with fear, And, starting up to drive the beasts away, I woke.—A terror of great darkness lay About me, but I lifted up my head And listened. There was moaning, like the dead That moan at night, and over me there flowed, So soft, so warm—it was my master’s blood, Who writhed beside me, dying! With a bound I sprang up, empty-handed, groping round For spear or sword, when, lo, a young strong man Was close to me and slashed, and the sword ran Deep through my flank. I felt its passage well, So deep, so wide, so spreading . . . then I fell. And they, they got the bridles in their hand And fled  .... Ah! Ah! This pain. I cannot stand. I know, I saw, thus much. But why or how Those dead men went to death I cannot know, Nor by whose work. But this I say; God send ’Tis not foul wrong wrought on us by a friend. Good charioteer of that ill-fortuned king, Suspect us not. ’Tis Greeks have done this thing. But yonder Hector comes. He hath been shown The foul deed, and thy sorrows are his own. Ye workers of amazement! Have your eyes No sight? Ye watch and let these Pass—and our friends are butchered in their sleep— And then pass back unwounded, laughing deep Amid the galleys at the news they bring Of Trojan sluggards and the fool their king? Great God, ye never baulked them as they came, Nor smote them as they went! Who bears the blame Of this but thou? Thou wast the watcher set To guard this host till morn. I tell thee yet For this deed—I have sworn by Zeus our Lord !— The scourge of torment or the headsman’s sword Awaits thee. Else, be Hector in your thought Writ down a babbler and a man of nought. Woe, woe! It was for thee, only for thee, I must have gone, O Help and Majesty, That time with message that the fires were burning. Mine eye was keen; I swear by Simois river, It never drooped nor slumbered, never, never, From eve till morning! My master, verily, I am innocent utterly, Build not such wrath against me, Lord, nor harden Thy heart; let Time be judge; and if in deed Or word I have offended, let me bleed! Bury me here alive! I ask no pardon. Why threaten them? Art thou a Greek to blind My barbarous wit so nimbly, in a wind Of words? This work was thine. And no man’s head Is asked by us, the wounded and the dead, Save thine. It needs more play, and better feigned, To hide from me that thou hast slain thy friend By craft, to steal his horses.—That is why He stabs his friends. He prays them earnestly, Prays them to come; they came and they are dead. A cleaner man was Paris, when he fled With his host’s wife. He was no murderer. Profess not thou that any Greek was there To fall on us. What Greek could pass the screen Of Trojan posts in front of us, unseen? Thyself was stationed there, and all thy men. What man of yours was slain or wounded when Your Greek spies came? Not one; ’tis we, behind, Are wounded, and some worse than wounded, blind Forever to the sunlight. When we seek Our vengeance, we shall go not to the Greek. What stranger in that darkness could have trod Straight to where Rhesus lay—unless some God Pointed his path? They knew not, whispered not, Rhesus had ever come. . . . ’Tis all a plot. Good allies I have had since first the Greek Set foot in Complaint of Hector. Thou wilt be the first. I have not, by God’s mercy, such a thirst For horses as to murder for their sake. Odysseus! Yet again Odysseus! Take All the Greek armies, is there one but he Could have devised, or dared, this devilry? I fear him; yea, fear in mine own despite, Lest Dolon may have crossed him in the night And perished; ’tis so long he cometh not. I know not who Odysseus is, nor what. I know it was no Greek that wounded us. To think thus pleasures thee? Well, have it thus. Home, home! To die at home and rest my head! Nay, die not, friend. We have enough of dead. How can I live? Lost, and my master slain. My house will shelter thee and heal thy pain. Thy house? Will murderers’ nursing give me peace? Still the same tale! This man will never cease. My curse rest—not on Hector, but on those Who stabbed us, as thou say’st.—Ah, Justice knows! There, lift him.—Bear him to my house. Take pains, If care can do it, that the man complains No more of Troy.—Ye others, bear withal To Priam and the Elders of the Wall My charge, that, where the cart-road from the plain Branches, they make due burial for our slain. Back from the heights of happiness, Back, back, to labour and distress Some god that is not ours doth lead Troy and her sons; He sows the seed, Who knows the reaping? Ah! Ah! My king, what cometh? There appears Some Spirit, like a mist of tears; And in her arms a man lieth, So young, so wearied unto death; To see such vision presageth Wrath and great weeping. Nay, look your fill, ye Trojans. It is I, The many-sistered Muse, of worship high In wise men’s hearts, who come to mourn mine own Most pitifully loved, most injured, son, For whose shed blood Odysseus yet shall pay Vengeance, who crawled and stabbed him where he lay. With a dirge of the Thracian mountains, I mourn for thee, O my son. For a mother’s weeping, for a galley’s launching, for the way to Troy; A sad going, and watched by spirits of evil. His mother chid him to stay, but he rose and went. His father besought him to stay, but he went in anger. Ah, woe is me for thee, thou dear face, My belovèd and my son! Goddess, if tears for such as thee may run In our low eyes, I weep for thy dead son. I say to thee: Curse Odysseus, And cursèd be Diomede! For they made me childless, and forlorn for ever, of the flower of sons. Yea, curse Helen, who left the houses of She knew her lover, she feared not the ships and sea. She called thee, called thee, to die for the sake of Paris, Belovèd, and a thousand cities She made empty of good men. O conquered Thamyris, is this thy bane Returned from death to pierce my heart again? Thy pride it was, and bitter challenge cast ’Gainst all the Muses, did my flesh abase To bearing of this Child, what time I passed Through the deep stream and looked on Strymon’s face, And felt his great arms clasp me, when to old Pangaion and the earth of hoarded gold We Sisters came with lutes and psalteries, Provoked to meet in bitter strife of song That mountain wizard, and made dark the eyes Of Thamyris, who wrought sweet music wrong. I bore thee, Child; and then, in shame before My sisterhood, my dear virginity, I stood again upon thy Father’s shore And cast thee to the deeps of him; and he Received and to no mortal nursing gave His child, but to the Maidens of the Wave. And well they nursed thee, and a king thou wast And first of Through thine own hills thy bloody chariot passed, Thy battered helm flashed, and I had no fear; Only to Troy I charged thee not to go: I knew the fated end: but Hector’s cry, Borne overseas by embassies of woe, Called thee to battle for thy friends and die. And thou, Athena—nothing was the deed Odysseus wrought this night nor Diomede— ’Tis thine, all thine; dream not thy cruel hand Is hid from me! Yet ever on thy land The Muse hath smiled; we gave it praise above All cities, yea, fulfilled it with our love. The light of thy great Mysteries was shed By Orpheus, very cousin of this dead Whom thou hast slain; and thine high citizen Musaeus, wisest of the tribes of men, We and Apollo guided all his way: For which long love behold the gift ye pay! I wreathe him in my arms; I wail his wrong Alone, and ask no other mourner’s song. Hector, thou hearest. We were guiltless here, And falsely spake that Thracian charioteer. Always I knew it. Had we any need Of seers to tell this was Odysseus’ deed? For me, what could I else, when I beheld The hosts of What but with prayers and heralds bid my friend Come forth and fight for He owed me that.—Yet, now my friend is slain, His sorrow is my sorrow. On this plain I will uplift a wondrous sepulchre, And burn about it gifts beyond compare Of robes and frankincense. To Troy’s relief He came in love and parteth in great grief. My son shall not be laid in any grave Of darkness; thus much guerdon will I crave Of Death’s eternal bride, the heavenly-born Maid of Demeter, Life of fruits and corn, To set this one soul free. She owes me yet, For Orpheus widowed, an abiding debt. To me he still must be—that know I well— As one in death, who sees not. Where I dwell He must not come, nor see his mother’s face. Alone for ever, in a caverned place Of silver-veinèd earth, hid from men’s sight, A Man yet Spirit, he shall live in light: As under far Pangaion Orpheus lies, Priest of great light and worshipped of the wise. Howbeit an easier anguish even to me Falls than to Thetis in her azure sea; For her son too shall die; and sorrowing, First on the hills our band for thee shall sing, Then for Achilles by the weeping wave. Pallas could murder thee, but shall not save Thy foe; too swift Apollo’s bolt shall fly. O fleshly loves of sad mortality, O bitter motherhood of these that die, She that hath wisdom will endure her doom, The days of emptiness, the fruitless womb; Not love, not bear love’s children to the tomb. The dead man sleepeth in his mother’s care; But we who battle still—behold, the glare Of dawn that rises. Doth thy purpose hold, Hector, our arms are ready as of old. March on; and bid the allies with all speed Be armed, bind fast the yoke upon the steed, Then wait with torches burning, till we sound The Tuscan trump.—This day we shall confound, God tells me, their Greek phalanx, break their high Rampart and fire the galleys where they lie. Yon first red arrow of the Sun, that brings The dawn to Troy, hath freedom on his wings. The Chief hath spoken: let his will Be law, ye Trojans.—Raise the cry To Arms! To Arms! and down the line Of allies pass the battle-sign. The God of And men may conquer ere they die.  \n",

                                                                                                             Men of Cadmus’s city, he who guards from the stern the concerns of the State and guides its helm with eyes untouched by sleep must speak to the point.  For if we succeed, the responsibility is heaven’s; but if—may it not happen—disaster is our lot, Eteocles would be the one name shouted many times throughout the city in the citizens’ resounding uproars and laments.  From these evils may Zeus the Defender, upholding his name, shield the city of the Cadmeans! But now you—both he who is still short of his youthful prime, and he who, though past his prime, still strengthens the abundant growth of his body, and every man still in his prime, as is fitting—you must aid the State and the altars of your homeland’s gods so that their honors may never be obliterated.  You must aid, too, your children, and Mother Earth, your beloved nurse.  For welcoming all the distress of your childhood, when you were young and crept upon her kind soil, she raised you to inhabit her and bear the shield, and to prove yourselves faithful in this time of need.  And so, until today, God has been favorably inclined, for though we have long been under siege, the war has gone well for the most part through the gods’ will.  But now, as the seer, the herdsman of birds, informs us, using his ears and his mind to understand with unerring skill the prophetic birds unaided by sacrificial fire—he, master of such prophecy, declares that the greatest Hurry each of you to the battlements and the gates of our towered walls! Rush with all your armor! Fill the parapets and take your positions on the platforms of the towers.  Stand your ground bravely where the gates open out, and do not be afraid of this crowd of foreigners. God will bring it to a good end. Eteocles, mighty prince of the Cadmeans, I have returned with a sure report of the army outside the walls; I myself am an eyewitness of their actions.  Seven warriors, fierce regiment-commanders, slaughtered a bull over a black shield, and then touching the bull’s gore with their hands they swore an oath by Ares, by Enyo, for their parents at home, and were shedding tears while so doing, but no piteous wailing escaped their lips.  For their iron- hearted spirit heaved, blazing with courage, as of lions with war in their eyes.  Your knowledge of these things was not delayed by fearfulness; for I left them casting lots to decide how each commander, his post assigned by chance, would lead his regiment against the gates.  Therefore, choose the bravest men of the city and station them quickly at the outlets of the gates.  For nearby already the is advancing in a flurry of dust, and glistening foam splatters the plain in drops from the horses’ pantings.  So you, like the careful helmsman of a ship, secure the city before Ares’ blasts storm down upon it; for the wave of their army now crashes over the dry land. Seize the first opportune moment for doing this.  For all else, I, on my part, will keep a reliable eye on the lookout, and you, by learning from my certain report what happens beyond the gates, shall remain unharmed. O Zeus and Earth, and gods that guard our city, and Curse, May they never hold the free land and city of Cadmus beneath the yoke of slavery! Be our protection! I am certain that what I ask is in our common interest; for a State that prospers pays honors to its gods. In terror I wail loud cries of sorrow.  Their army is let loose!  Leaving camp, —look!—the mounted throng floods swiftly ahead.  The dust whirling in the air tells me this is so—its message is speechless, yet clear and true. and rumbles like a resistless torrent crashing down a mountainside. ready for battle, rushes at full speed against the city. of our ancestral gods’ statues? Do you hear the clash of shields, or does it escape you? When, if not now, shall we place sacred robes and wreaths on the statues to accompany our prayers? your own land, Ares, where you have dwelt since long ago?  God of the golden helmet, look, look upon the city that you once cherished! Oh come all you gods who guard our city and its land! See this suppliant band of maidens praying to be saved from slavery.  A torrent of men, their helmet plumes tossing, crashes around the city, sped on by the blasts of Ares.  No! Father Zeus, all-accomplishing, fend from us altogether capture at the hands of the enemy. The Argives encircle the citadel of Cadmus.  Terror of their weapons of war shakes us, as the bridles in the horse’s jaws rattle the sound of death.  Seven bold captains, conspicuous among the army in spear-wielding harnesses, at the seven gates Pallas, Zeus-born power delighting in battle, prove yourself the savior of the city! And you, lord of steeds, ruler of the deep, Poseidon, with your fish-striking weapon grant us release from our fears, grant us release! You too, Ares—pity us!—guard the city named for Cadmus and make evident your closeness And Cypris, you who are the first mother of our race, defend us who are sprung from your blood.  We come to you, crying out in prayers for your divine ears. And you, Apollo, lord of the Wolf, Ah! Ah! I hear the rattle of chariots encircling the town.  O lady Hera! The hubs are creaking beneath the axles’ load.  Beloved Artemis! The air rages at the shaking of spears! What is happening to our city? What will the future bring? And where does God finally lead us? Ah! Ah! A hail of stones strikes our battlements from afar.  O beloved Apollo! There is the clang of bronze-bound shields at the gates.  O son of Zeus, in whom dwells the sacred power to decide in battle war’s outcome! And you, blessed queen Onca, defend your seven- gated home! All-powerful divinities, you gods and goddesses who wield the power to guard the towers of our land, do not betray our city that now toils under the spear to an alien-tongued army.  Hear us, hear, as is right, the prayers we maidens offer with outstretched hands. Beloved spirits, encompass the city to deliver it from ruin and show that you love it.  Consider the people’s offerings, and as you consider, help us. Remember, I beg, our city’s worship, rich in sacrifice.. You intolerable things! I ask you, is this the best way to save the city? Does it hearten our army here besieged, when you fall before the images of the gods that guard the city and shout and shriek—behavior that moderate people despise? May I never share my home with the female race, neither in time of evil nor in pleasant prosperity! When things go well for her, her boldness is unbearable, but when she is afraid, she is an even greater evil for home and city.  So now your cries as you rushed here and there in panicked flight have rattled the citizens into dispirited cowardice.  The cause of the enemy outside our gates is excellently strengthened by your behavior, while we inside are ruined by our own people. This is the sort of trouble you will have if you dwell with women.  Now if anyone fails to obey my authority—whether man or woman or something in between—a sentence of death will be decreed for him and by no means whatsoever will he escape destruction by stoning at the people’s hands. It is for the man to take care of business outside the house; let no woman make decrees in those matters.  Keep inside and do no harm! Do you hear me or not? Am I speaking to the deaf? Dear son of Oedipus, I grew afraid when I heard the clatter of the crashing chariots, when the hubs screamed as they whirled around the wheel, and when I heard the sound of the steering gear, fire-forged bits, in the horses’ mouths. Well, then, has a helmsman ever found a way to safety by fleeing from stern to prow, when his ship is foundering in high seas? But trusting in the gods I came in haste to their ancient statues, when the deadly blizzard of falling stones thundered against the gates.  Just then I set out in fear to pray to the Blessed Ones that they spread their protection over the city. Pray that the rampart withstand the enemy spear.  Yes, the outcome is in the gods’ hands—but then, it is said that the gods of a captured city abandon it. Never so long as I live may this divine assembly abandon us, nor may I live to see the city overrun and the army seizing it with hostile fire! When you invoke the gods, do not be ill-advised.  For Obedience is the mother of Success, wife of Salvation—as the saying goes. So she is, but the power of god is supreme, and often in bad times it raises the helpless man out of harsh misery even when stormclouds are lowering over his eyes. It is the man’s duty to offer victims and sacrifices to the gods when they test their enemy; your duty is to be silent and to remain inside the house. By the will of the gods we inhabit an unconquered city, and the rampart withstands the enemy throng. What indignation makes you resent this? I do not begrudge your honor of the divine race; but lest you make the citizens cowardly, be calm and do not be overly fearful. When I heard the strange and jumbled clashes, I came in trembling fear to this citadel, our seat of worship. If, then, you hear that men are dying or wounded, do not seize on the news with loud wailing.  For this is the food of Ares, human blood. Oh, but I hear horses snorting! Hear them, then, but not too clearly. The city groans from deep in the earth, as though we are surrounded. Surely it is enough that I am making plans for this? I am terrified—the crashing at the gates is increasing. Won’t you be silent, and speak none of this throughout the city? Divine company, do not betray our fortifications! Damn you! Will you not endure these events in silence? Gods of our city! Do not let my fate be slavery! You would enslave both me and all the city. Almighty Zeus, turn your missile against the enemy! O Zeus, what a breed you have made for us in women! A breed steeped in misery, just like men whose city is captured. Why are your words ill-omened, when you still grasp the gods’ statues? In my weakness fear controls my tongue. If only you would grant my plea for a small service. Please state it as quickly as possible, and I will quickly know what to do. Be silent, wretched woman; do not terrify your own men. I am silent.  I will suffer what is destined together with the others. I welcome this sentiment of yours over what you said before. And in addition, keep your distance from the gods’ images and make a stronger prayer, that the gods fight on our side.  And once you have heard my prayers, then sing the victory song, the sacred cry of joy and goodwill, our Greek ritual of shouting in tribute, that brings courage to our friends and dissolves fear of the enemy. the citizens shall redden the gods’ altars with the blood of sheep and sacrifice bulls to the gods—this is my vow—and offer trophies, while I will crown their holy temples with the spoil of the enemy’s spear-pierced garments. Make this kind of prayer to the gods, without your previous lamentation, nor with wild and useless panting; for you will not escape your destiny any the more.  As for me, I will go station six men, with me as the seventh, as champions to oppose the enemy in proud fashion at the seven exits in the wall, even before speedy messengers or swift-rushing reports arrive and inflame us with urgent need. I heed him, but through terror my heart finds no repose. Anxieties border upon my heart and kindle my fear of the army surrounding our walls, as a trembling dove fears for her children in the nest because of snakes that are dangerous bed-fellows. For against our fortifications some are advancing with all their men, all in formation.  Ah, what will become of me? Others are hurling jagged boulders at the citizens on all sides.  O Gods born of Zeus, by every means rescue our city and people, sprung from Cadmus! What more fertile plain will you find in place of ours, if you abandon to the enemy this deep-soiled land and the water of Dirce which is the most nourishing of the streams that earth-encircling Poseidon and Tethys’ children pour forth? Therefore, divine guardians of the city, hurl murderous destruction on the men outside our walls and panic that makes them throw away their weapons, and so win glory for these citizens.  Defend the city and remain in possession of your home and throne in answer to our shrill, wailing prayers! It is a great cause for grief to hurl a primeval city to Hades in this way, quarry and slave of the spear, ravaged shamefully in the dusty ashes by an And grief, too, to let the women be led away captive—ah me!—young and old, dragged by the hair, like horses, with their cloaks torn off them. A city, emptied, shouts out as the human booty perishes with mingled cries.  A heavy fate, indeed, my fear anticipates. It is a lamentable thing that modest girls should be plucked unripe, before the customary rites, and should make a loathsome journey from their homes.  What? I declare that the dead will do better than the captives; for when a city is subdued—ah, ah!—many and miserable are its sufferings. Man drags off man, or kills, or sets fires; the whole city is defiled with smoke.  Mad Ares storms, subduing the people and polluting reverence. Tumults swell through the town, and against it a towering net is advancing.  Man falls before man beneath the spear.  Sobs and wails over gore-covered babes, just nursed at their mothers’ breasts, resound.  Rape and pillage of those fleeing through the city are the deeds of one’s own blood.  Plunderer joins up with plunderer; the empty-handed calls to the empty-handed, wishing to have a partner, each greedy for neither less nor equal share.  Reason exists for imagining what will come after this. The earth’s varied fruits, fallen to the ground, give pain, a bitter sight for the maid-servants. In jumbled confusion the abundant gifts of earth are carried away by reckless looting waves.  Young women, enslaved, suffer a new evil: a bed of misery, prize of the conquering enemy’s spear, as though of a prospering husband— they can expect the coming of the nightly rite, which gives aid to tears and anguish! The scout, I believe, is bringing some fresh news of the army to us, my friends, since the joints of his legs are hastily speeding as they carry him on his mission. And, indeed, here is our lord himself, the son of Oedipus, at the right moment to hear the messenger’s report.  Haste makes his stride uneven, too. It is with certain knowledge that I will give my account of the enemy’s actions, how each man according to lot has been posted at the gates.  Tydeus is already storming opposite the Proetid gates; but the seer will not allow him to ford the Ismenus because the omens from the sacrifices are not favorable. Yet Tydeus, raging and eager for battle, shouts like a serpent hissing at high noon, and lashes skilled Oecles’ son, with the taunt that he cringes in cowardice before death and battle.  With such cries he shakes three overshadowing plumes, his helmet’s mane, while from under his shield, bells forged of bronze therein ring out a fearsome clang.  He has this haughty symbol on his shield: a well-crafted sky, ablaze with stars, and the brightness of the full moon shining in the center of the shield, the moon that is the most revered of the stars, the eye of night.  Raving so in his arrogant armor, he shouts beside the river-bank, craving battle, like some charger that fiercely champs at the bit as he waits in eagerness for the trumpet’s war-cry. Whom will you send against him? Who will be capable of standing as our champion at the Proetid gate when its bars are loosened? I would not tremble before any mere ornaments on a man.  Nor can signs and symbols wound and kill—crests and bell have no bite without the spear. And regarding this \"night\" which you describe on his shield, sparkling with heaven’s stars—perhaps the folly of it might yield to one some prophetic understanding.  For should night fall on this man’s eyes as he dies, then to its bearer this arrogant symbol would prove rightly and justly named; and it is against himself that he will have prophesied this outrageous violence.  Now as for me, against Tydeus I will station the trusty son of Astacus as defender of this gate, since he is full noble and reveres the throne of Honor and detests proud speech.  He is slow to act disgracefully, and he has no cowardly nature.  His race springs from the men sown of the dragon’s teeth, from one of those whom Ares spared, and so Melanippus is truly born of our land.  Ares will decide the outcome with a throw of the dice; but Justice, his kin by blood, indeed sends this man forth to keep the enemy spear from the mother that gave him birth. May the gods grant success to our champion, since he rises up in a just cause, to battle for his city! But I shudder to watch the bloody deaths of men cut down for the sake of their own people. Yes, may the gods so grant success to this man.  Capaneus is stationed at the Electran gates, another giant of a man, greater than the one described before. But his boast is too proud for a mere human, and he makes terrifying threats against our battlements—which, I hope, chance will not fulfil! For he says he will utterly destroy the city with god’s will or without it, and that not even conflict with Zeus, though it should fall before him in the plain, will stand in his way. The god’s lightning and thunderbolts he compares to midday heat.  For his shield’s symbol he has a man without armor bearing fire, and the torch, his weapon, blazes in his hands; and in golden letters he says Against such a man make your dispatch—who will meet him in combat, who will stand firm without trembling before his boasts? Here too gain follows with interest from gain. Capaneus makes his threats, ready to act, irreverent toward the gods, and giving his tongue full exercise in wicked glee, he, though a mere mortal, sends a loud and swollen boast to Zeus in heaven.  But I trust that the fire-bearing thunderbolt will justly come to him, and when it comes it will not be anything like the sun’s mid-day heat.  And against him, even though he is a big talker, a man of fiery spirit, mighty Polyphontes, is stationed, a dependable sentinel with the good will of guardian Artemis and the other gods.  Now tell me about another one allotted to other gates! Death to him who exults so arrogantly over the city! May the thunderbolt stop him before he leaps into my home and plunders me from my maiden chambers with his outrageous spear! Now I will tell you about the man who next drew station at the gates.  The third lot leaped out of the upturned bronze helmet for Eteoclus, to hurl his band against the Neistan gates.  He whirls his horses as they snort through their bridles, eager to fall against the gate.  Their muzzles whistle in a barbarian way, filled with the breath of their haughty nostrils. His shield is decorated in great style: an armored man climbs a ladder’s rungs to mount an enemy tower that he wants to destroy.  This one, too, shouts in syllables of written letters that even Ares could not hurl him from the battlements. Send a dependable opponent against this man, too, to keep the yoke of slavery from our city. I would send this man here, and with good fortune. He will not withdraw from the gate in fear of the thunder of the horses’ furious snorting; but either he will die and pay the earth the full price of his nurture, or will capture two men and the city on the shield, and then adorn his father’s house with the spoils. Tell me about another’s boasts and do not begrudge me the full tale! O champion of my home, I pray that this man will have good fortune, and that there will be bad fortune for his enemies.  As they boast too much against the city in their frenzied mind, so, too, may Zeus the Requiter look on them in anger! Another, the fourth, has the gate near Onca Athena and takes his stand with a shout, Hippomedon, tremendous in form and figure.  I shuddered in fear as he spun a huge disk—the circle of his shield, I mean— I cannot deny it.  The symbol-maker who put the design on his shield was no lowly craftsman: the symbol is Typhon, spitting out of his fire-breathing mouth a dark, thick smoke, the darting sister of fire. And the rim of the hollow-bellied shield is fastened all around with snaky braids.  The warrior himself has raised the war-cry and, inspired by Ares he raves for battle like a maenad, with a look to inspire fear.  We must put up a good defense against the assault of such a man, for already Rout is boasting of victory at the gate. First Onca Pallas, who dwells near the city, close by the gate, and who loathes outrageousness in a man, will fend him off like a dangerous snake away from nestlings.  Moreover, Hyperbius, Oenops’ trusty son, is chosen to match him, man to man, as he is eager to search out his fate in the crisis that chance has wrought—neither in form, nor spirit nor in the wielding of his arms does he bear reproach.  Hermes and the gods on their shields also meet as enemies.  The one has fire-breathing Typhon, while father Zeus stands upright on Hyperbius’ shield, his lightening bolt aflame in his hand.  And no one yet has seen Zeus conquered. Such then is the favor of the divine powers: we are with the victors, they with the vanquished, if Zeus in fact proves stronger in battle than Typhon.  And it is likely that the mortal adversaries will fare as do their gods; and so, in accordance with the symbol, Zeus will be a savior for Hyperbius since he resides on his shield. I am sure that Zeus’ antagonist, since he has on his shield the unloved form of an earth-born deity, an image hated by both mortals and the long-lived gods, will drop his head in death before the gate. Let it be so! Next I describe the fifth man who is stationed at the fifth, the Northern gate opposite the tomb of Amphion, Zeus’s son.  He swears by his spear which, in his confidence, he holds more to be revered than a god and more precious than his eyes, that he will sack the city of the Cadmeans in spite of Zeus.  He says this, the beautiful child of a mountain-bred mother—a warrior, half man, half boy, and his beard’s first growth is just now advancing on his cheeks, his youth in first bloom, thick, upspringing hair.  But now he makes his advance with a savage heart and a terrifying look, not at all like the maidens he’s named for. shield, his body’s circular defence, on which the Sphinx who eats men raw is cleverly fastened with bolts, her body embossed and gleaming.  She carries under her a single Cadmean, so that against this man chiefly our missiles will be hurled. He does not seem to have come to do any petty trading in the battle, nor to shame the making of his long journey—he is Parthenopaeus of If only they would get from the gods what they wish for, because of those unholy boasts of theirs, then surely they would perish in utter ruin and misery.  There is a man for this one, too, whom you name an Arcadian, a man who does not boast, but who knows the thing to do— Actor, brother of him I named before.  He will not allow words that lack deeds to overrun his gate and increase fear, nor will he let in a man who carries on his hostile shield the image of the ravenous, detested beast. That beast outside his shield will blame the man who carries her into the gate, when she has taken a heavy beating beneath the city’s walls.  If the gods are willing, what I speak may prove true! His words penetrate to my heart, my hair stands on end as I hear the loud threats of these loud-boasting, impious men.  May the gods destroy them here in our land! The sixth man I will name is of the highest moderation and a seer brave in combat, mighty Amphiaraus. Stationed at the Homoloid gate, he repeatedly rebukes mighty Tydeus with evil names So the seer spoke as untroubled he held his all-bronze shield.  No symbol was fixed to his shield’s circle.  For he does not wish to appear the bravest, but to be the bravest, as he harvests the fruit of his mind’s deep furrow, where his careful resolutions grow. I advise you to send wise and brave opponents against him.  He who reveres the gods is to be feared. Ah, the pity of fate’s omen when it makes a just man associate with the irreverent! In all things, nothing is more evil than evil partnership. Its fruit should not be gathered in: the field of recklessness yields a harvest of death.  For it may be that a pious man, embarked shipboard with sailors hot for some crime, perishes along with the sort of men hated by the gods; or, a man, though upright himself, when among fellow-citizens who hate all strangers and neglect the gods, may fall undeserving into the same trap as they, and be subdued, struck by the scourge of God that strikes all alike. although a moderate, just, noble, reverent man and a great prophet, mixes with impious, rash-talking men against his own judgment, men stretching out in a procession that is long to retrace, So then, I expect that he will not even charge the gates: not because he lacks courage or is weak-willed, but because he knows that he must meet his end in battle, if the prophecies of Loxias are to come to fruition—the god usually either holds silent or speaks to the point. Just the same, I will station a man against him, mighty Lasthenes, a gate-keeper who hates foreigners.  He has the wisdom of an old man, but his body is at its prime: his eyes are quick, and he does not let his hand delay for his spear to seize what is left exposed by the shield. Still it is God’s gift when mortals succeed. Gods, hear our just prayers and fulfil them, that the city may have good fortune! Turn aside the evils suffered in war onto those who invade our land! May Zeus strike them with his thunderbolt outside the walls and slay them! Last I will tell of the seventh champion, him at the seventh gate, and shouts the paian in triumph over its capture, he may then meet you in combat, and once he kills you, that he may perish at your side, or, if you survive, make you pay with banishment in the same way as you dishonored him with exile.  Mighty Polynices shouts such threats and invokes his native gods, the gods of his fatherland, to watch over his prayers in every way.  He holds a shield, a perfect circle, newly-made, with a double symbol cleverly fastened on it: a woman modestly walking in the fore leads a man in arms made, it appears, of hammered gold.  She claims to be Justice, as the lettering indicates, O my family sired by Oedipus, steeped in tears, driven to madness by the gods and by the gods detested! Ah, now indeed our father’s curses are brought to fulfillment.  But neither weeping nor wailing is proper for me now, lest a grief even harder to bear is brought to life.  As for him whose name is so very fitting, Polynices, we shall know soon enough what the symbol on his shield will accomplish, whether the babbling letters shaped in gold on his shield, together with his mind’s wanderings, will bring him back.  If Justice, Zeus’s maiden daughter, were attending his actions and his thoughts, this might be so.  But as it is, neither when he escaped the darkness of his mother’s womb, nor in childhood, nor at any point in his early manhood, nor when the beard first thickened on his cheek, did Justice acknowledge him and consider him worthy.  And even now I do not think that she is standing by his side to aid the destruction of his fatherland. Indeed, Justice would truly be false to her name, if she should ally herself with a man so utterly audacious in his plans.  Trusting in this fact I will go and stand against him—I myself in person.  Who else has a more just claim? Commander against commander, brother against brother, enemy against enemy, I will take my stand. Quick, bring my greaves to protect against spears and stones! No, son of Oedipus, most dear of our men, do not be like in temperament to him who is called by such an evil name. It is enough that Cadmeans are advancing to close combat with Argives.  That bloodshed can be expiated.  But when men of the same blood kill each other as you desire, the pollution from this act never grows old. If indeed a man should suffer evil, let it be without dishonor, since that is the only benefit for the dead. But you cannot speak of any glory for happenings that are at once evil and held in dishonor. For what are you so eager, child? Do not let mad lust for battle fill your soul and carry you away.  Reject this evil passion while it is still young. Since God hastens the deed so urgently, let the whole race of Laius, hated by Phoebus, be swept on the wind to Cocytus’ destined flood! A savage desire eats away at you, drives you to murder, blood-sacrifice proscribed by divine law, whose only fruit is bitterness. True, my own beloved father’s hateful, ruinous curse hovers before my dry, unweeping eyes, and informs me of benefit preceding subsequent death. No, do not let yourself be driven to it.  You will not be called a coward if you retain life nobly.  Will not the avenging Erinys in her dark aegis leave your house, when the gods receive sacrifice from your hands? The gods, it seems, have already banished us from their care, yet they admire the grace we offer them when we perish.  So then, why should we cringe and shy away from deadly fate? It is only at this moment that death stands close by you, for the divine spirit may change its purpose even after a long time and come on a gentler wind.  But now it still seethes. Yes, the curses of Oedipus have made it seethe in fury. Too true were the phantoms in my sleeping visions, predicting the division of our father’s wealth! Obey us women, although you do not like to. Recommend something that can be accomplished; your request need not be lengthy. Do not yourself take the road to the seventh gate! Let me assure you, you will not blunt my sharpened purpose with words. And yet any victory, even a cowardly one, is nonetheless held in honor by God. A soldier must not embrace that maxim. But are you willing to harvest the blood of your own brother? When it is the gods who give you evils, you cannot flee them. I shudder in terror at the goddess who lays ruin to homes, a goddess unlike other divinities, who is an unerring omen of evil to come.  I shudder that the Erinys invoked by the father’s prayer will fulfil the over-wrathful curses that Oedipus spoke in madness.  This strife that will destroy his sons drives the Erinys to fulfillment. A stranger distributes their inheritance, a Chalybian immigrant from savage-hearted iron that apportions land for them to dwell in, as much as they can occupy in death when they have lost their share in these wide plains. But when both have died, each killing the other in mutual slaughter, and the earth’s dust has swallowed the black streams of their blood, who could offer sacrifice that might make purification? Who could cleanse them of their pollution? O, the new troubles of this house mixed with its evils of before! Indeed I speak of the ancient transgression, now swift in its retribution.  It remains even into the third generation, ever since Laius—in defiance of Apollo who, at his Pythian oracle at the earth’s center, said three times that the king would save his city if he died without offspring— Ever since he, overcome by the thoughtlessness of his longing, fathered his own death, the parricide Oedipus, who sowed his mother’s sacred field, where he was nurtured, and endured a bloody crop.  Madness united the frenzied bridal pair. Now it is as if a sea of evils pushes its swell onward.  As one wave sinks, the sea raises up another, triple-crested, which crashes around the city’s stern.  In between a narrow defense stretches—no wider than a wall.  I fear that the city will be overthrown along with its kings. For the compensation is heavy when curses uttered long ago are fulfilled, and once the deadly curse has come into existence, it does not pass away.  When the fortune of seafaring merchants has grown too great, it must be thrown overboard. For whom have the gods and divinities that share their altar and the thronging assembly of men ever admired so much as they honored Oedipus then, when he removed that deadly, man-seizing plague from our land? But when, his sanity regained, he grew miserable in his wretched marriage, then carried away by his grief and with maddened heart he accomplished a double evil.  With the hand that killed his father he struck out his eyes, which were dearer to him than his children. Next he launched brutal, wrathful words against the sons he had bred—ah! curses from a bitter tongue—that wielding iron in their hands they would one day divide his property. So now I tremble in fear that the swift-running Erinys will bring this to fulfillment. Take heart, you daughters who were nurtured by your mother.  Our city has escaped the yoke of slavery; the boasts of the powerful men have fallen to the ground. The city enjoys fair weather and has taken on no water even though it has been buffeted by many waves.  The walls hold, and we have fortified the gates with champions fully capable in single-handed combat.  For the most part all is well, at six of the gates. But lord Apollo, the reverend leader of the seventh, What novel happening will further affect the city? The city is saved, but the kings born of the same seed— Who? What did you say? I am out of my mind with fear of your report. Control yourself now and listen.  The sons of Oedipus— Ah, miserable me, I am prophet of these evils. In truth, beyond all question, struck down in the dust— Are they lying out there? This is hard to bear, but say it just the same. The men are dead, murdered by their very own hands. Then with hands so fraternal did they each kill the other together? Yes, so all too equal was their destiny to them both.  All alone, in truth, it consumes the ill-fated family.  We have cause in this for joy and tears— the one because the city fares well, the other because the leaders, the two generals, have divided the whole of their property with hammered Scythian steel.  They will possess only that land they take in burial, swept away as they were in accordance with their father’s curses. O great Zeus and the divine powers that guard our city, you who indeed protect these walls of Cadmus, should I rejoice and shout in triumph for the unharmed safety of the city, or should I lament our leaders in war, now wretched, ill-fated and childless?  Indeed, in exact accordance with their name and as O black curse on the family, Oedipus’ curse, now brought to fulfillment! A chill of horror falls about my heart. In frenzy like a maenad I make my song for the grave as I hear of their corpses dripping with blood, how they died through the workings of cruel fate.  This song of the spear, sung to the flute, is indeed born of an ill omen. The curseful utterance of their father has done its work and not fallen short.  Laius’ plans, made in disobedience, have kept their force.  I am anxious for our city; divine decrees do not lose their edge. O bringers of immense grief, you have done in this a deed beyond belief, yet lamentable troubles have indeed come. Ah, pity you senseless men, whom friends could not persuade and evils could not wear down! To your misery you have captured your father’s house with the spear. To their misery, indeed, they found a miserable death in the outrage done their house. Pierced through your left sides, pierced indeed— through those sides that were born from one womb! Ah, strange ones! Ah, the curses that demand death for death! Right through, as you say, were they struck, with blows to house and body by an unspeakable wrath and by the doom, called down by their father’s curse, which they shared without discord. Groaning spreads throughout the city, too: the walls groan; the land that loves its sons groans.  But for those who come after them there remains their property, on which account the strife of those terrible-fated men came to fulfillment in death. nor is Ares agreeable. Under strokes of iron they are come to this, and under strokes of iron there await them—what, one might perhaps ask—shares in their father’s tomb. Our shrill, heart-rending wail goes with them—product of lamentation and pain felt of its own accord—a wail from a distressed mind, joyless, pouring forth tears from a heart that wastes away as I weep for these two princes. Over these poor men it can be said that they did much to harm our citizens and also the ranks of all the foreigners who died in abundance in the fighting. she gave birth to these sons, who have thus ended their lives with kindred hands giving death for death. Of the same seed, in truth, they were utterly destroyed in unloving divisions, in maddened discord, in the ending of their strife. Ruthless is that which resolved their strife, the stranger from across the sea, sharpened iron rushed from the fire.  Ruthless, too, was Ares, the cruel divider of their property, who made their father’s curses come true. They hold in misery their allotted portion of god-given sorrows.  Beneath their corpses there will be boundless wealth of earth. your race with many troubles! In the final outcome the Curses have raised their piercing cry, now that the family is turned to flight in all directions.  A trophy to Ruin now stands at the gate where they struck each other and where, having conquered them both, the divine power stayed its hand. You were struck as you struck. You died as you killed. By the spear you killed— By the spear you died— Your deed made you wretched. You suffering made you wretched. Let the lament come. Let the tears come. You are laid out for mourning— Though you did the killing. Ah me! Ah me! My heart is mad with wailing. My heart groans within me. Ah, the grief, brother all-lamentable. And you also, brother all-wretched. You perished at the hands of your nearest and dearest. And you killed your nearest and dearest. Twofold to tell of— Twofold to look upon— Are these sorrows so close to those. Fraternal sorrows stand close by fraternal sorrows. O Fate, giver of grievous troubles, and awful shade of Oedipus, black Erinys, you are indeed a mighty force. Ah, me Ah, me Sorrows hard to behold— He showed me when he returned from exile. But he made no return after he had killed. He was saved, but lost his life. He lost it, all too truly. And took this one’s life away. Wretched family! Wretched suffering! Kindred sorrows full of groans! Sorrows steeped in tripled griefs. O Fate, giver of grievous troubles, and awful shade of Oedipus, black Erinys, you are indeed a mighty force. Now you know of the Erinys by experience— And you are made aware no later— When you came back to our city, Yes, to face him with your spear. A tale of destruction! Destruction to look upon! Oh, the grief— Oh, the evils— For home and land. Above all for me, And more also for me. Ah I pity your grievous suffering, my king. Pity for you both, most lamentable of all men. You were possessed by delusion. Where shall we lay them in the earth? Ah, where their honor is greatest. To lie beside their father, a cause for him of sorrow. It is my duty to announce the will and decrees of the council on behalf of the people of this our Cadmean city. for hating the enemy he chose death in the city and driven by piety towards his ancestral shrines, he died without reproach where it is an honor for the young to die.  This is how I was commanded to speak regarding him.  But as for his brother, it is decreed that this corpse of Polyneices is to be cast out of the city unburied to be torn by dogs, since he would have been the destroyer of the land of the Cadmeans, if one of the gods had not used his brother’s spear to prevent him.  Even in death he will retain the stain of his guilt against his fathers’ gods, whom he dishonored when he launched a foreign army against the city to take it.  For this reason it is decreed that he will receive his reward by being buried without honor beneath the winged birds; and that no labor of the hands shall attend him by building up a burial mound nor shall anyone offer him reverence in shrill-sung laments. He is to be refused the honor of being carried in funeral procession by his loved ones.  Such is the decree of the Cadmean authorities. I at least will say something to the rulers of the Cadmeans: even if no one else is willing to share in burying him, I will bury him alone and risk the peril of burying my own brother.  Nor am I ashamed to act in defiant opposition to the rulers of the city.  A thing to be held in awe is the common womb from which we were born, of a wretched mother and unfortunate father.  Therefore, my soul, willingly share his evils, even though they are unwilling, and live in kindred spirit with the dead.  No hollow-bellied wolves will tear his flesh—let no one carrying the earth in the fold of my linen robe.  With my own hands I will cover him over—let no one I forbid you to act thus in violation of the city. I forbid you to make useless proclamations to me. And yet a citizenry that has escaped evil can be harsh. Let it be harsh! This man will not be unburied. What! Will you honor with burial a man whom the city detests? For a long time now the gods have ceased to hold him in honor. No, he was honored until he put this land in jeopardy. He suffered evil and gave evil in return. But this act was against all the citizens, not only one man. Discord is the last of the gods to close an argument.  I will bury him.  Put an end to your big talk. Well then, follow your own rash plan, but I forbid it. Ah, misery! O Erinyes, far-famed destroyers of families, goddesses of death who have thus laid ruin to the family of Oedipus, digging it up from the roots! What will happen to me? What should I do? What plan shall I devise?  How can I have the heart neither to weep for you nor escort you to your tomb? But I am afraid and turn away in terror of the citizens.  You, at least, Eteocles, will have many mourners, while he, wretched man, departs without lamentation and has a dirge sung only by one sister.  Now who could comply with that? Let the city take action or not take action against those who lament for Polynices.  We, at all events, will go and bury him with her, following the funeral procession.  For this grief is shared by all our race, and the city approves as just different things at different times. We will go with this other corpse, as the city and justice, too,  approves. For after the blessed gods and powerful Zeus, he it was who saved the city of the Cadmeans from being capsized and flooded by a wave of foreign men—he beyond all others.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                May Zeus who guards suppliants look graciously upon our company, which boarded a ship and put to sea from the outlets of the fine sand of the whose pastures border It was Danaus, our father, adviser and leader, who, considering well our course, decided, as the best of all possible evils, that we flee with all speed over the waves of the sea and find a haven on could we come with these wool-wreathed branches in our hands, sole weapons of the suppliant? O realm, O land, and clear water;  gods on high and earth-bound powers, grievous in your vengeance, which inhabit the tomb; and you, Zeus the Savior, invoked third the thronging swarm of violent men born of and perish by the tempest’s buffeting blasts, if they ever lay their hands on us, their cousins, and mount unwilling beds from which Right holds them aloof. And now I invoke, as our champion from beyond the sea, the calf born of Zeus, the offspring of the flower-grazing cow, our ancestress, the caress of Zeus’ breath. The appointed period confirmed itself in a name suited to the event—Epaphus To him I cry for help. And now in the region wherein our first mother pastured, by recounting the story of her distress of long ago, I shall now set forth reliable proofs to the inhabitants of the land; and other evidence, though unexpected, will yet appear.  Men will come to know the truth as my tale proceeds. Now if by chance there be some neighbor in the land who knows the song of birds, when our complaint greets his ear, he will fancy that he hears the voice of Metis, Tereus’ piteous wife, the hawk-chased nightingale. For she, constrained to leave her green leaves, laments pitifully her accustomed haunts, and composes the tale of her own child’s doom—how he perished, destroyed by her own hand, victim of the wrath of an unnatural mother. Even so I, indulging my grief in Ionian strains, pain my tender face summered by which has fled from the haze-shrouded land. But, gods of our race, hear, and regard with favor the cause of righteousness; if you refuse youth fulfillment of its arrogant desires, and readily abhor violence, you would be righteous toward marriage. Even for those who flee hard-pressed from war there is an altar, a shelter against harm through respect for the powers of heaven. But may Zeus grant that it go well with us.  For Zeus’ desire is hard to trace:  it shines everywhere, even in gloom, together with fortune obscure to mortal men. Safely it falls, and not upon its back, whatever deed comes to pass at Zeus’ nod; for the pathways of his understanding stretch dark and tangled, beyond comprehension. From their high-towering hopes he hurls mankind to utter destruction; yet he does not marshal any armed violence— all that is wrought by the powers divine is free from toil.  Seated on his holy throne, unmoved, in mysterious ways he accomplishes his will. So let him look upon human outrageousness —in what way it shoots up men in their wooing of us, sprouted from thoughts of evil intent, having a frenzied purpose as its irresistible spur, and deluded, turning its thoughts to folly. Such piteous strains of woe I utter in my pain, now shrill, now deep, blended with falling tears—Alas, alas! groans appropriate to funeral wails; though I live, I chant my own dirge. I invoke and many times I lay my hands upon my Sidonian veil and tear its linen fabric to shreds. Sacrifices in satisfaction of vows are given freely to the gods when all fares well, if only there be escape from death. Alas, alas, perplexing troubles!  Where will this wave of trouble bear me away? I invoke well, O land, you understand my barbarous speech—, and many times I lay my hands upon my Sidonian veil and tear its linen fabric to shreds. Our oars, indeed, and our timbered ship, bound with yellow rope to withstand the sea, sped me on by help of favoring winds, unharmed by all tempests; nor have I reason for complaint.  But may the all-seeing Father establish a kindly issue in due time— That the mighty race of our honorable mother escape the embrace of man (ah me), unwedded, unvanquished. And may Zeus’ pure daughter, she who holds securely the sacred wall, willingly, meeting my will, look upon me; and, grieved at our pursuit, come with all her might, a virgin to a virgin’s aid, to deliver me— That the mighty race of our honorable mother may escape the embrace of man (ah me), unwedded, unvanquished. Yet, if she will not, we, a dark, sun-burned race, with suppliant boughs will invoke the underworld Zeus, Zeus the great host of the dead; for if the gods of Ah Zeus! On account of the poisonous hate of Io vengeance from the gods pursues us. your consort’s sky-conquering spite; for a stormy sea  follows a harsh wind. And Zeus shall then be liable to the charge of injustice that he hates the child of the heifer, the child whom he himself begat long ago, his very own, and now he holds his face averted from our prayers. May he from above hear our call! Ah Zeus! On account of the poisonous hate of Io vengeance from the gods pursues us. I know your consort’s sky-conquering spite; for a stormy sea  follows a harsh wind. My children, you must be prudent.  A prudent captain of your voyage was your reliable old father here with whom you came.  And now that I have considered with foresight what may befall us here on land, I charge you, record my injunctions on the tablets of your minds and guard them. I see dust, the voiceless herald of an army; the axle-driven wheels are not silent in their sockets. I behold a throng, armed with shields and holding spears, with steeds and curved chariots. Perhaps they are the princes of the land come to look on us, informed by messengers.  But whether a harmless man or one driven by savage wrath rouses this expedition, it is better, damsels, in any case, to seat yourselves at that mound sacred to the assembled gods. Stronger than a castle is an altar—an impenetrable shield.  As quick as you can, gather in your left hands your white-wreathed suppliant boughs, sacred emblems of Zeus the merciful. Reply to the strangers, as is fitting for aliens, in piteous and plaintive language of necessity, telling them clearly of your flight, how it was unstained by deed of blood. Above all let no arrogance accompany your speech, and reveal nothing impious in your peaceful eyes, from your respectful face. In your  speech neither interrupt, nor hesitate—for this would offend these people. And remember to be submissive: you are an alien, a fugitive, and in need.  Bold speech does not suit the weak. Father, your words are prudent, and they fall on prudent ears. I will take heed of your wise words, and hold them in memory.  May Zeus, the author of our race, behold us! May he indeed behold you, and with a gracious eye. I would like even now to be seated by your side. Then do not delay, but put your purpose into action. O Zeus, have pity upon our troubles lest we are ruined. If he wishes it so, all will end well.  Invoke now also that bird of Zeus We invoke the saving beams of the sun. Pure Apollo, too, who, though a god, was exiled once from heaven. Knowing our lot, he may well have pity on mortals. May he have pity indeed, and stand by ready to defend. Whom, further, of these divinities must I invoke? I behold a trident here, the token of its god. Well did he send us here and well may he receive us in this land. Here, too, is Hermes, according to the Hellenic custom. May he then announce good tidings to the free! Honor to the mutual altar of all these protecting powers; and seat yourselves on holy ground like a flock of doves in dread of hawks of the same feathered tribe— kindred, yet foes, who would defile their race.  If bird prey on bird, how can it be pure?  And how can man be pure who would seize from an unwilling father an unwilling bride?  For such an act, not even in Hades, after death, shall he escape arraignment for outrage. There also among the dead, so men tell, another Zeus holds a last judgment upon misdeeds.  Take heed and reply in this manner, that victory may attend your cause. From where comes this band we address, clothed in foreign attire and luxuriating in closely-woven and barbaric robes?  For your apparel is not that of the women of this makes me wonder.  And yet, truly, I see that branches usually carried by suppliants are laid by your side before the gods assembled here—as to this alone can if your voice were not here to inform me. You have not spoken falsely about our clothing. But, for my part, how am I to address you?  As commoner, as spokesman, bearer of the sacred wand, As for that, answer and speak to me with confidence. For I am Pelasgus, offspring of Palaechthon, whom the earth brought forth, and lord of this land; and after me, their king, is rightly named the race of the Pelasgi, who harvest the land.  Of all the region through which the pure Strymon flows, on the side toward the setting sun, I am the lord.  There lies within the limits of my rule the land of the Perrhaebi, the parts beyond Pindus close to the Paeonians, and the mountain ridge of The ground where we stand is Apian land itself, and has borne that name since antiquity in honor of a healer.  For Apis, seer and healer, the son of Apollo, came from defiled by the pollution of bloody deeds of old, caused to spring up—plagues charged with wrath, an ominous colony of swarming serpents.  Of these plagues Apis worked the cure by sorcery and spells to the content of the and for reward thereafter earned for himself remembrance in prayers. Our tale is brief and clear.  Argives we claim to be by birth, offspring of a cow blest in its children.  And the truth of this I shall confirm in full. Foreign maidens, your tale is beyond my belief—how your race can be from women of ride on camels for steeds, having padded saddles, and dwell in a land neighboring the Aethiopians.  And had you been armed with the bow, certainly I would have guessed you to be the unwed, flesh-devouring Amazons.  But inform me, and I will better comprehend how it is that you trace your race and lineage from Is there a report that once in this land of Certainly she was; the tradition prevails far and wide. And is there some story, too, that Zeus was joined in love with a mortal? This entanglement was not secret from Hera. What then was the result of this royal strife? The goddess of Argos transformed the woman into a cow. And while she was a horned cow, did not Zeus approach her? So they say, making his form that of a bull lusting for a mate. What answer then did Zeus’ stubborn consort give? She placed the all-seeing one to stand watch over the cow. What manner of all-seeing herdsman with a single duty do you mean? Argus, a son of Earth, whom Hermes slew. What else did she contrive against the unfortunate cow? A sting, torment of cattle, constantly driving her on. They call it a gadfly, those who dwell by the Well then, it drove her by a long course out of the land. Your account agrees with mine in all respects. So she came to And Zeus begot a son by the touching of his hand. Who is it then that claims to be the cow’s Zeus-begotten calf? Epaphus, and truly named from     And who was his offspring? Belus, who had two sons and was father of my father here. Now tell me his wisely-given name. Danaus: and he has a brother with fifty sons. Reveal his name ungrudgingly.  I think you indeed have some share in this land from old. But how did you bring yourselves to leave the home of your fathers? What stroke of fortune befell you? Lord of the Pelasgians, of varying color are the ills of mankind, and nowhere can you find trouble of the same plume. For who dreamed that a kindred race, sprung of old, would thus in unexpected flight find haven at Why have you come as suppliants of these gods congregated here, holding in your hands those white-wreathed, fresh-plucked boughs? So as not to be made slave to By reason of hatred?  Or do you speak of unlawfulness ? Who would purchase their lords from among their kin? In this way families have enhanced their power. And it is easy then, if things go ill, to separate from a wife. How then am I to deal with you in accordance with my sacred duty? By not surrendering us at the demand of A serious request—to take upon myself a dangerous war. But Justice protects her champions. True, if she had a share in the matter from the beginning. Show reverence for the ship of state thus crowned. I shrink as I gaze upon these shaded shrines. Yet heavy is the wrath of Zeus, god of the suppliant. I see a company of assembled gods assenting beneath the shade of fresh-plucked boughs.  Nevertheless may this affair of claimants to the friendship of our city bring no mischief in its wake!  And let no feud come upon the state from causes unforeseen and unforestalled; for the state has no need of such trouble. Indeed, may Justice, daughter of Zeus the Apportioner, Justice who protects the suppliant, look upon our flight that it bring no mischief in its wake.  But you, aged in experience, learn from one of younger birth.  If you show mercy to a suppliant ... from a man of holiness. It is not my own house at whose hearth you sit.  If the state is stained by pollution in its commonalty, in common let the people strive to work out the cure.  For myself, I will pledge no promise before I have communicated these events to all the citizens. You are the state, you are the people.  Being subject to no judge, you rule the altar, your country’s hearth by your will’s sole ordinance; and, enthroned in sole sovereignty, you determine every issue.  Beware pollution! Pollution on my enemies!  But without harm I do not know how to help you.  And yet again, it is not well advised to slight these supplications.  I am perplexed, and fear possesses my soul whether to act, or not to act and take what fortune sends. Look to him who looks down from above, to him, the guardian of mortals sore-distressed, who appeal to their neighbors, yet do not obtain the justice that is their right. The wrath of Zeus, the suppliant’s god, remains, and will not be softened by a sufferer’s complaints. If the sons of You must plead in accordance with the laws of the land you have fled, that they have no authority over you. Never, oh never, may I fall subject to the power and authority of these men.  I am determined to flee to escape this marriage that offends my soul, piloting my course by the stars. Take Justice as your ally, and render judgment for the cause deemed righteous by the gods. The judgment is not easy—do not make me the judge.  I have declared already that, though I am ruler, I will not do this thing without the consent of my people, lest hereafter, if any evil befall, the people should say, Kindred to both in blood, Zeus surveys both sides alike in this dispute with an impartial scale, apportioning, as is due, to the wicked their wrongdoing and to the godly their works of righteousness. When these things are thus equally balanced, why do you fear to act justly? Surely there is need of deep and salutary counsel; need for a keen-sighted eye, not confused, to descend, like some diver, into the depths; that to the state above all things this matter may not work mischief, but may end well for us; that strife may not seize you for its prize, nor yet that we surrender you from these seats of sanctuary, and bring upon ourselves the dire, abiding vengeance of the all-destroying god, who, even in the realm of Death, does not set his victim free.  Surely you cannot think there is no need of salutary counsel? Take counsel, and, as is your sacred duty, prove yourself our sacred champion.  Do not betray the fugitive who has been impiously cast out and driven from afar. I have considered them; and I am driven to this cruel predicament. I must take upon myself a mighty war against one side or the other. There is no escape, it is as firmly fixed as a ship’s hull drawn tight by windlasses.  There is no result without grievous hurt. Now when goods are plundered from a homestead, other goods may come by grace of Zeus, guardian of household wealth; as a tongue that has shot arrows beside the mark, one speech may be the healer of another.  But to avoid the shedding of kindred blood, surely there is need of sacrifice and that many a victim fall to many a god as a deliverance from impending harm.  For truly, it is to my undoing that I have come into this quarrel; and yet I prefer to be unskilled rather than practised in the lore of foretelling ill.  But may my judgment belie itself and all go well! Hear now the end of my appeals for compassion. I hear; say on.  It shall not escape me. I have breast-bands and girdles to gather up my robes. Such things are proper, no doubt, for women. In these then, be sure, I have a beautiful instrument— Tell me what speech you plan to utter. If you will not give some pledge to this group— What will the contrivance of the sashes do for you? To adorn these images with tablets of strange sort. Your words are riddling; come, explain in simple speech. To hang ourselves from the statues of these gods. I detect a threat that is a lash upon my heart. You have grasped my intention, for I have cleared your vision. And on many sides there are difficulties hard to wrestle with; for, like a flood, a multitude of ills bursts on me. It is a sea of ruin, fathomless and impassable, which I am launched upon, and nowhere is there a haven from distress.  For should I not pay the debt due to you, the pollution you name is beyond all range of speech; yet if I take my stand before the walls and try the issue of battle with the sons of Aged father of these maidens, take these boughs straightway in your arms and place them upon other altars of the country’s gods, that all the natives may see the sign that you have come in suppliance.  And let no random word fall against me; for the people could complain against authority.  It may well be that some, stirred to compassion at the sight, will hate the wantonness of the troop of males, and that the people will be more friendly towards you; for  all men are well disposed to the weaker cause. We consider it worth much to have gained a champion who is compassionate.  Yet send escorts and guides of the country’s people with me so we may find where the gods who protect your city have their altars at the temple porches and their . . . seats, and that we may go safely through the town.  My shape is unlike yours, for Come, men, the stranger speaks well.  Be his guides to the altars of the city and to the sanctuaries of the gods.   Do not speak at length with whomever you meet on the way while you are bringing this seafarer to be a suppliant at the hearths of the gods. You told him, and let him go as directed. But what of me? What am I to do?  Where do you assign security to me? Leave your boughs here, tokens of your distress. Behold, I leave them at your signal and command. Go now along this level space about the sanctuary. But it is not holy ground.  How can it keep me safe? Be assured, we will not surrender you to winged creatures’ ravishment. But what about those whom we dread worse than evil serpents? Speak with good omen, as I have spoken auspiciously to you. No wonder I am fretful through alarm of mind. Excessive fear is always uncontrolled. Cheer my heart by deeds as well as words. Your father will not leave you here alone for long.  I am going now to call together the people of the land, that I may make the masses friendly; and I will instruct your father in what things he should say. Now stay here and beseech the gods of the land with prayers to grant what you desire, while I go to advance your cause.  May persuasion and efficacious fortune attend me! Lord of lords, most blessed among the blessed, power most perfect among the perfect, O blessed Zeus, hear! And from your offspring ward off in utter abhorrence the lust of men, and into the purple sea cast their black-benched madness! Look benignly upon the women’s cause, look upon our race ancient in story, and recall the happy tale of our ancestress, the woman of your love. Show that you remember all, you who laid your hand upon Io.  It is from Zeus that we claim descent, and it is from this, our homeland, that we went forth. I have come here to the prints of ancient feet, my mother’s, even to the region where she was watched while she browsed among the flowers— into that pasture, from which Io, tormented by the gad-fly’s sting, fled in frenzy, traversing many tribes of men, and according to fate, cut in two the surging strait, marking off the land upon the farther shore. And through the land of and the hollow vales of the land of Aphrodite that teems with wheat. Harassed by the sting of the winged herdsman she gains at last the fertile groves sacred to Zeus, that snow-fed pasture assailed by Typho’s fury, and the water of the And mortals, who in those days dwelled in the land, shook with pallid terror at the terrible sight as they beheld a being fearsome, half-human, part cow and part of woman; and they were astonished at the monstrous thing.  And then, at last, who was it who calmed the far-wandering, the wretched, the sting-tormented Io? Zeus, it was, through endless time, the lord, . . . and by the unharming might of his hand, and by his divine breath, she gained rest, and let fall the sorrowing shame of tears. And, taking Zeus as her support, according to a true story, she bore a blameless son— Throughout long ages blessed.  All the earth cries aloud, Which of the gods has accomplished deeds which, with good reason, warrant more justly my appeal to him?  Father himself and lord, he planted us with his own hand; he is the mighty fashioner of our race, ancient in wisdom, who devises everything, whose breath makes all things prosper, Zeus himself. He does not sit upon his throne by mandate of another and hold his dominion beneath a mightier. No one sits above him whose power he holds in awe.  He speaks, and it is done—he hastens to execute whatever his counselling mind conceives. Be of good cheer, my children, all goes well on the part of the citizens.  Decrees, carrying full authority, have been passed. Hail, our envoy, harbinger of tidings most welcome, But tell us—to what end has the decision been carried, and to what course does the majority of the people’s votes incline? Action was taken by the Argives, not by any doubtful vote but in such a way as to make my aged heart renew its youth.  For the air bristled with right hands held aloft as, in full vote, they ratified this resolution into law: Such was the persuasive speech that the king of the Pelasgians delivered on our behalf, uttering the solemn warning that never in the future should the city feed the great wrath of Zeus, protector of the suppliant; and declaring  that, should a twofold defilement—from strangers and from natives at once—arise before the city, it would become fodder for distress past all relief.  Hearing these words, the Come, let us invoke blessings upon the Argives in return for blessings.  And may Zeus, god of strangers, behold the offerings of gratitude voiced by a stranger’s lips, that they may in true fulfilment reach their perfect goal. Divinely-born gods!  Hear now as I pour forth libations for blessings upon our kindred.  Never may the wanton lord of war, insatiate of battle-cry, Ares, who reaps a human harvest in alien fields, destroy this Pelasgian land by fire; for they had compassion for us, and cast a vote in our favor, respecting  our pitiable flock, suppliants in the name of Zeus. Nor did they cast their votes for the side of the males, disregarding the women’s cause, since they honored the avenging eye of Zeus, against which there is no battling, and what house would have it defiling its roof? altars shall they please the gods. Therefore let there fly forth from our overshadowed empty this city of its men nor strife stain the soil of the land with the blood of slain inhabitants.  But may the flower of its youth be unplucked, and may Ares, the partner of Aphrodite’s bed, he who makes havoc of men, not shear off their bloom. And may the altars, where the elders gather, blaze in honor of venerable men. Thus may their state be regulated well, if they hold in awe mighty Zeus, and, most of all, Zeus the warden of the guest, who by venerable enactment guides destiny straight. We pray that other guardians be always renewed, and that Artemis-Hecate And let no murderous havoc come upon the realm to ravage it, by arming Ares—foe to the dance and lute, parent of tears—and the shout of civil strife. And may the joyless swarm of diseases settle far from the heads of the inhabitants, and to all the young people may Lyceus May Zeus cause the earth to bring forth its tribute of fruit by the produce of every season; may their grazing cattle in the fields have abundant increase, and may they obtain all things from the heavenly powers. May minstrels sing hymns of praise at the altars; and from pure lips let there proceed the phorminx-loving chant. May the people who control the state guard its privileges free from fear— a prudent government counselling wisely for the public prosperity.  And should they have recourse to arms may they inflict no loss, but grant just rights of covenant to the stranger within their gates. And may they worship forever the gods who possess the land with native honors of laurel bough held aloft, and oxen slain, even as their fathers did before their time. Since reverence for parents stands written third among the statutes of Justice, to whom honor supreme is due. I commend these sensible prayers, dear children; but do not be troubled yourselves when you hear the unexpected and startling tidings your father has to tell.  From my post of look-out here on the sanctuary of suppliants I see that ship; for it is well-marked and does not escape me: the trimming of its sail, its side-guards, and the prow that with its eyes scans its onward course, obeying—all too well for those to whom it is unfriendly—the guiding rudder at the stern.  The men on board are plainly seen, their black limbs showing from their white attire.  The rest of the ships and all the assisting fleet stand clear in view:  but the leading ship herself has furled her sail and draws near the shore with full sweep of sounding oars.  Yet you must face the matter calmly and with self-control, and not be unmindful of these gods.  For my part, I will secure allies and advocates to urge our cause, and return.  Perhaps some herald or envoys may come, eager to seize you as a prize and drag you away, but nothing will happen: do not fear them. Yet in the event that we should be slow in bringing aid, it would be better not to forget for a moment the means of help you have here at hand.  Courage! In good time, assuredly, and on the day ordained, he who dishonors the gods will suffer punishment. Father, I am afraid. With what swift wings the ships approach!  There is not much time left. I am possessed by dreadful fear if truly my long flight has been of no profit.  Father, I am consumed with fright. Since the vote of the Argives was final, be of good cheer, my children; they will fight in your defence, I know this well. But they will find here a force with arms well-seasoned by the noonday heat. This would profit us well, my children, should they incur both Heaven’s hate and yours. Yet there is a saying that wolves are stronger than dogs; the papyrus-fruit does not conquer the wheat-ear. A fleet in getting under way is not so speedy, nor yet in anchoring, when the securing cables must be brought ashore; and even at anchorage shepherds of ships do not feel immediately secure, above all if they have arrived on a harborless coast when the sun is sinking into night. In a cautious pilot night is likely to beget anxiety.  Then, too, the disembarking of an army cannot be effected with success before a ship has gained confidence in her moorings.  But, for all your terror, remember not to neglect the gods. old in years, but with youth in his heart and on his tongue. O land of hills, land of our righteous veneration, what is to be our lot?  To what region in the Apian land are we to flee, if anywhere there be some dark hiding-place?  Ah that I might become black smoke that draws near to the clouds of Zeus; or, soaring aloft without wings, vanish out of sight like viewless dust and dissolve into nothingness! The evil is no longer escapable; my heart is darkened and trembling; the look-out my father held has brought me ruin.  I am undone with terror. Rather would I meet my doom in a noose than suffer the embraces of a man I loathe.  Death before that, with Hades for my lord and master! Ah that somewhere in the upper air I might find a seat against which the dank clouds turn into snow, or some bare, inaccessible crag, beyond sight, brooding in solitude, beetling, vulture-haunted, to bear witness to my plunge into the depths before I am ever forced into a marriage that would pierce my heart! Thereafter I refuse not to become a booty for dogs and a banquet for the local birds; for death is freedom from misery-loving evils.  Come death, death be my doom, before the marriage-bed!  How can I yet find some means of escape to deliver me from marriage? Shriek aloud, with a cry that reaches heaven, strains of supplication to the gods; O father, give heed that they  are somehow accomplished to my safety and tranquility.  Behold deeds of violence with no kind glance in your just eyes! Have respect for your suppliants, O Zeus, omnipotent upholder of the land! For the males of the race of a fugitive, with clamorous lewdness and seek to lay hold of me with violence.  But yours alone is the beam of the balance, and without you what is accomplished for mortals? Wail and shout and call upon the gods—you will not escape the Egyptian ship. Cry out, utter a strain of woe more bitter still. Go to the double-prowed ship as quickly as possible.  Let no one delay, for dragging by force has no mercy on locks of hair. Alas, father; the help of the sacred images deludes me.  Like a spider, he is carrying me seaward step by step—a nightmare, a black nightmare! Oh! Oh! Mother Earth, mother Earth, avert his fearful cries!  O father Zeus, son of Earth! I do not fear the native gods, be assured. They did not rear me, nor by their nurture did they bring me to old age. He rages close to me, the two-footed serpent. Like some viper he lays hold of me and bites my foot.  Alas, alas!  Mother Earth, mother Earth, avert his fearful cries!  O father Zeus, son of Earth! If you will not resign yourself and get to the ship, rending will have no pity on the fabric of your garments. We are lost!  O King, we are suffering impious violence!  You there!  What are you doing?  What kind of arrogance has incited you to do such dishonor to this realm of Pelasgian men?  Indeed, do you think you have come to a land of women? For a barbarian dealing with Hellenes, you act insolently. Many are the misses of your wits, and your hits are none. And in this case where have I gone wrong and transgressed my right? First of all, you do not know how to act as a stranger. I not know?  How so, when I simply find and take my own that I had lost? To what patrons of your land was your notice given? To Hermes, the Searcher, greatest of patrons. For all your notice to the gods, you do them no reverence. I revere the deities by the While ours are nothing, as I understand you? I shall carry off these maids unless someone tears them away. If you so much as touch them, you will regret it, and right soon. I hear you; and your speech is far from hospitable. No, since I have no hospitality for despoilers of the gods. I will go and tell My proud spirit will not ponder on this threat. But that I may know and tell a plainer tale —for it is fitting that a herald make exact report on each detail—what message am I to deliver?  Who is it, am I to tell on my return, that has despoiled me of this band of women, their own cousins?  It is not, I suppose, by voice of witnesses that the god of battle judges cases like this; nor is it by the gift of silver that he settles dispute; no! If that be the case, many a one shall fall and shuffle off his life. In blessings may you abound, noble Pelasgian, in requital for your blessings!  But, if it pleases you, send our brave father Danaus here to be our adviser and leader of our counsels.  For it befits him, rather than ourselves, to advise us where we should establish our home and what neighborhood is friendly.  All the world is ready to cast reproach on those who speak a foreign tongue.  But may all be for the best! And you, dear handmaidens, preserving your fair fame and provoking no angry utterances on the part of the native folk, take up your stations even as Danaus has allotted her duty of attendance unto each. My children, it is right to offer prayers to the Argives and to sacrifice and pour libations to them as to Olympian gods; for they are our saviors in no doubtful manner.  They heard from my lips the conduct of your cousins toward their own kinfolk, and were moved to bitterness against them; but to me they assigned this escort of spearmen, that I might have rank and honor, and might not be ambushed and perish by the death of the spear, and so an ever-living burden come upon the land.  Recipients of such favors as these, it becomes us to hold gratitude in yet higher honor from the bottom of our hearts.  And in addition to the many other wise injunctions of your father recorded in your memory, inscribe this too—that an unknown company is proved by time.  For in an alien’s case, all the world bears an evil tongue in readiness, and it is easy lightly to utter  defiling slander.  Therefore I would have you bring no shame upon me, now when your youthful loveliness attracts men’s gaze. The tender ripeness of summer fruit is in no way easy to protect; beasts despoil it—and men, why not?— and brutes that fly and those that walk the earth.  Love’s goddess spreads news abroad of fruit bursting ripe. . . . So all men, as they pass, mastered by desire, shoot an alluring arrow of the eye at the delicate beauty of virgins.  See to it, therefore, that we do not suffer that in fear for which we have endured great toil and ploughed the great waters with our ship; and that we bring no shame to ourselves and exultation to our enemies. Housing of two kinds is at our disposition, the one Pelasgus offers, the other, the city, and to occupy free of cost.  These terms are easy.  Only pay heed to these behests of your father, and count your chastity more precious than your life. May the Olympian gods grant us good fortune in all the rest! But, concerning the bloom of my virginity, father, be of good cheer, for, unless some evil has been devised of Heaven, I will not swerve from the former pathway of my thoughts. Come now away, glorifying the blessed gods, lords of the city both those who guard the town and those who dwell about Erasinus’ ancient stream. And you handmaidens take up the song.  Let the theme of our praise be this city of the Pelasgians, and no longer let the homage of our hymns be paid to But to the rivers that pour their gentle draught through the land and increase the birth of children, soothing its soil with their fertilizing streams. May pure Artemis look upon this band in compassion, and may marriage never come through Cytherea’s compulsion.  May that prize belong to my enemies!  \n",

mounted on a chariot inlaid with gold and whirling out your flame with swift horses, what an unfortunate beam you shed on that Cadmus left I am known as the daughter of Menoeceus, and Creon is my brother by the same mother. They call me Jocasta, for so my father named me, and I am married to Laius. Now when he was still childless after being married to me a long time in the palace, he went and questioned Phoebus, and asked for us both to have sons for the house. But the god said: in Hera’s meadow and the crag of Cithaeron, after piercing his ankles with iron spikes; from which So she suckled the child that I had borne and persuaded her husband she was its mother. When my son had become a man, with tawny beard, either because he had guessed or learned it from another, he set out for the shrine of Phoebus, wanting to know for certain who his parents were; and so did Laius, my husband, seeking to learn if the child he had exposed was dead. And the two of them met at the branching road of gave it to Polybus, his foster-father. Now when the Sphinx was oppressing and ravaging our city, after my husband’s death, my brother Creon proclaimed my marriage: that he would marry me to anyone who should guess the riddle of the crafty maiden. It happened somehow that my son, Oedipus, guessed the Sphinx’s song; I bore my son two sons, Eteocles and the hero Polyneices, and two daughters; the one her father called Ismene; the other, which was the elder, I named Antigone. Now when Oedipus, who endured so much, learned that he was married to his mother, he inflicted a dreadful slaughter upon his eyes, making the pupils bloody with a golden brooch. But when my sons grew to bearded men, they hid their father behind bars, so that his misfortune, needing as it did much skill to hide it, might be forgotten. He is still living in the house. Afflicted by his fate, he makes the most unholy curses against his sons, praying that they may divide this house with a sharp sword. So they were afraid that the gods might fulfil his prayers if they dwell together; and they made an agreement, that Polyneices, the younger, should first leave the land in voluntary exile, while Eteocles should stay and hold the scepter, and then change places yearly. But as soon as Eteocles was seated on the bench of power, he did not leave the throne, but drove Polyneices into exile from this land.  So Polyneices went to demanding the scepter of his father and his share of the land. Now I, to end their strife, have persuaded one son to meet the other under truce, before seizing arms; and the messenger I sent tells me that he will come. O Zeus, dwelling in the bright folds of heaven, save us, and reconcile my sons! For you, if you are really wise, must not allow the same mortal to be forever wretched.  for the topmost story of the house, to see the to you, my royal mistress; and when I have examined everything, I will tell you what I saw and heard from the Argives, when I carried the terms of the truce from here to Polyneices and back from him again. No, there is no citizen near the house, so mount the ancient cedar steps, and view the plains; beside Ismenus’ streams and the fountain of Dirce see the great army of the enemy. Stretch out your hand to me from the stairs now, stretch it out, the hand of age to youth, helping me to rise. There! clasp it, maiden; you have come at the right time; for Pelasgia’s army is just upon the move, and they are separating the companies. O Lady Hecate, child of Leto! The plain is one lightning-flash of bronze. Ah! this is no ordinary home-coming of Polyneices, with the clash of many horses, many arms. Are the gates barred, and the brazen bolts fitted into Amphion’s walls of stone? Never fear! All is safe within the town. But see the first one, if you want to know him. Who is that one with the white crest, who marches before the army, lightly bearing on his arm a shield all of bronze? A captain, mistress. Who is he? Who is his family? Tell me his name, old man. He claims to be Mycenaean; by Ah, ah! How proud, how fearful to see, like an earth-born giant, with stars engraved on his shield, not resembling mortal race. Do you see the one crossing Dirce’s stream? His armor is quite different. Who is that? Tydeus, the son of Oeneus, Aetolian battle-spirit in his breast. Is this the one, old man, who married a sister of Polyneices’ wife? What a foreign look his armor has, half-barbarian! Yes, my child; all Aetolians carry shields, and are most unerring marksmen with their darts. Who is that youth passing by the tomb of Zethus, with long flowing hair, fierce to see? Is he a captain? For an armed crowd follows at his heels. That is Parthenopaeus, Atalanta’s son. May Artemis, who rushes over the hills with his mother, lay him low with an arrow, for coming against my city to sack it! May it be so, my child; but they have come here with justice, and my fear is that the gods will take the rightful view. Where is the one who was born of the same mother as I was, by a painful destiny? Oh! tell me, old friend, where Polyneices is. He is standing by Adrastus, near the tomb of Niobe’s seven unwed daughters. Do you see him? I see him, yes! but not clearly; I see the outline of his form, the likeness of his breast. Would I could speed through the sky, swift as a cloud before the wind, towards my own dear brother, and throw my arms about my darling’s neck, so long, poor boy! an exile. How distinguished he is with his golden weapons, old man, flashing like the morning rays! He will come to this house, under truce, to fill your heart with joy. Who is that, old man, on his chariot, driving white horses? That, lady, is the prophet Amphiaraus; with him are the victims, earth’s bloodthirsty streams. Daughter of the sun with dazzling zone, O moon, you circle of golden light, how quietly, with what restraint he drives, goading first one horse, then the other! But where is the one who utters those dreadful insults against this city? Capaneus? There he is, calculating how he may scale the towers, taking the measure of our walls up and down. O Nemesis, and roaring thunder-peals of Zeus and blazing lightning-bolts, oh! put to sleep his presumptuous boasting! This is the man who says he will give the Theban girls as captives of his spear to the women of Never, never, Lady Artemis, golden-haired child of Zeus, may I endure that slavery. My child, go inside, and stay beneath the shelter of your maiden chamber, now that you have had your wish and seen all that you wanted; for a crowd of women is coming toward the royal palace, as confusion enters the city. Now women by nature love scandal; and if they get some slight handle for their gossip they exaggerate it, for women seem to have pleasure in saying nothing wholesome about each other. From the Tyrian swell of the sea I came, a choice offering for Loxias from the island of to be a slave to Phoebus in his halls, where he dwells under the snow-swept peaks of over the unharvested plains, in the gusts of Zephyrus that ride from Chosen from my city as beauty’s gift for Loxias, to the land of Cadmus I came, sent here to the towers of Laius, the home of my kin, the famous sons of Agenor. And I became the handmaid of Phoebus, dedicated like his statues of wrought gold. But the water of Castalia is still waiting for me to drench the maiden glory of my hair for the service of Phoebus. Hail, rock that lights up a double-crested flash of fire above the frenzied heights of Dionysus; and the vine, that every day lets fall the lush cluster of grapes; and the holy cavern of the serpent and the gods’ watchtower on the hills, and the sacred snow-swept mountain! Would I were free of fear and circling in the dance of the deathless god, having left Dirce for the valleys of Phoebus at the center of the world. But now I find the impetuous god of war has come to battle before the walls, and is kindling a murderous blaze—may he not succeed!—for this city. For a friend’s pain is shared, and if this land with its seven towers suffers any mischance, Around the city a thick cloud of shields is kindling a shape of bloody battle, which Ares will soon learn, if he brings upon the sons of Oedipus the curse of the Furies. O that is not without justice. The doorkeeper’s bolts admitted me readily within the walls, and so I fear that now they have caught me in their nets, they will not let me out unscathed; so I must turn my eye in every direction, here and there, to guard against treachery. Armed with this sword, I shall inspire myself with the confidence that is born of boldness. Everything seems a danger to the daring, when their feet begin to tread an enemy’s country. Still I trust my mother, and at the same time mistrust her, the one who persuaded me to come here under truce. Well, there is help at hand, for the altar’s hearth is close and the house is not deserted. Come, let me sheath my sword in its dark scabbard and ask these women standing near the house, who they are. Ladies of another land, tell me from what country do you come to the halls of the My father was Oedipus, the son of Laius; my mother Jocasta, daughter of Menoeceus; and I am called Polyneices by the people of O kinsman of Agenor’s race, my royal masters who sent me here! I fall to my knees before you, lord, honoring the custom of my home. At last you have come to your native land. Hail to you! all hail! Lady, come from the house, open wide the gates!  Do you hear, you who gave birth to this man? Why do you delay to leave the sheltered hall and hold your son in your embrace? Maidens, I hear your Phoenician voice, and my old feet drag their tottering steps. O my son, at last after countless days I see your face; throw your arms about your mother’s breast, stretch out to me your cheeks and the dark, curly locks of your hair, overshadowing my neck. Hail to you! all hail! scarcely here in your mother’s arms, beyond hope and expectation. What can I say to you? How  in every way, by hands, by words, in the mazy delight of the dance, shall I find the pleasure of my former joy? Ah! my son, you left your father’s house desolate, when your brother’s outrage drove you away in exile. Truly you were missed alike by your friends and but taking instead these dark rags. While in the house the old blind man, always possessed by his tearful longing for the pair of brothers estranged from the home, rushed to kill himself with the sword or by the noose suspended over his chamber-roof, moaning his curses on his sons; and now he hides himself in darkness, always weeping and lamenting. And you, my child, I hear you have married and are begetting children to your joy in a foreign home, and are courting a foreign alliance, a ceaseless regret to me your mother and to Laius your ancestor, ruin brought by your marriage. I was not the one who lit for you the marriage-torch, the custom in marriage for a happy mother; Ismenus had no part at your wedding in supplying the luxurious bath, and there was silence through the streets of Curses on them! whether the sword or strife or your father that is to blame, or heaven’s visitation that has burst riotously upon the house of Oedipus; for on me has come all the anguish of these evils. Their offspring are a wonderful thing to women; all of them have some love for their children. Mother, I have come among enemies wisely or foolishly; but all men must love their native land; whoever says otherwise is pleased to say so, but his thoughts are turned elsewhere. I was so fearful and in such terror, lest my brother should kill me by treachery, that I came through the city sword in hand, looking all round. I had one advantage, the truce and your word, which brought me to to the paternal walls; and I arrived here weeping, to see after a long time my home and the altars of the gods, the training ground, scene of my childhood, and the water of Dirce, from which I was unjustly driven to live in a foreign city, a stream of tears flowing from my eyes. Now, grief upon grief, I see you What a terrible thing, mother, is hatred between dear friends. What is my old father doing within the house, looking on darkness? What of my two sisters? Surely the unhappy ones lament my exile? Some god with evil intent is destroying the race of Oedipus. So it began, my childbearing was unholy, and in an evil hour I married your father and you were born. But why repeat these horrors? What the gods send we have to bear. I am afraid to ask you what I would, for fear of stinging your heart; yet I long to. No, question me, leave out nothing; for your will, mother, is my pleasure too. Well then, first I ask you what I long to have answered. What is it, to be deprived of one’s country? Is it a great evil? The greatest; harder to bear than tell. What is it like? What annoys the exile? One thing most of all; he cannot speak his mind. This is a slave’s lot you speak of, not to say what one thinks. The follies of the rulers must be borne. That too is painful, to join in the folly of fools. Yet to gain our ends we must serve against our nature. Hope, they say, is the exile’s food. Yes, hope that looks so fair; but always in the future. But doesn’t time expose its emptiness? It has a certain winsome charm in misfortune. Where did you get your living, before your marriage found it for you? Sometimes I would have enough for the day, and sometimes not. Didn’t your father’s friends and guests assist you? Seek to be prosperous; friends are nothing in misfortune. Didn’t your noble breeding lead you to the heights? Poverty is a curse; breeding did not find me food. Man’s dearest treasure, it seems, is his country. You could not name how dear it is! How did you come to Loxias gave Adrastus an oracle. What was it? What are you saying? I cannot guess. That he should marry his daughters to a boar and a lion. What did you, my son, have to do with the name of beasts? I don’t know; the deity summoned me there to my destiny. Yes, for the god is wise; but how did you win your wife? It was night when I reached the porch of Adrastus. In search of a resting-place, because you were in exile? Yes; and then another exile came there. Who was he? He too was in trouble, surely. Tydeus; they say that Oineus is his father. But why did Adrastus compare you to wild beasts? Because we came to blows about our bed. Was it then that the son of Talaus understood the oracle? Yes, and he gave the two of us his two daughters. Are you blessed or cursed in your marriage? As yet I have no fault to find with it. How did you persuade an army to follow you here? Adrastus swore an oath to his two sons-in-law, So many Danaan and Mycenaean chiefs have joined me, doing me a bitter though needful service, for it is against my own city I am marching. Now I call the gods to witness, that it is not willingly I have raised the spear against my willing friends. But it belongs to you, mother, to dissolve this unhappy feud, and, by reconciling loving brothers, to end the trouble for me and you and the whole city. It has been said for a long time, but I will say it anyway: wealth is most valued by men, and of all things in the world it has the greatest power. This I have come to secure at the head of my great army; for a man well-born but poor is worth nothing. And see, Eteocles comes here to discuss the truce. It is your task, mother Jocasta, to speak such words as may reconcile your sons. Mother, I am here; I have come to do you a favor. What am I to do? Let some one begin the conference; for I stopped marshalling the citizens in pairs of companies around the walls, so that I might hear your arbitration between us, by which you persuaded me to admit this man under truce within the walls. Wait; haste does not carry justice with it; but slow deliberation often attains a wise result. Restrain the fierceness of your look and panting rage; for this is not the Gorgon’s severed head but your own brother whom you see has come. You too, Polyneices, turn and face your brother; for if you look at him, you will speak and listen to him the better. I want to give you both one piece of good counsel; when a man that is angry with his friend confronts him face to face, he ought only to keep in view the object of his coming, forgetting all previous quarrels. My son Polyneices, speak first, for you have come at the head of a Danaid army, alleging wrongful treatment; may some god be the judge and reconciler of the troubles. The words of truth are naturally simple, and justice needs no subtle interpretations, for it has a fitness in itself; but the words of injustice, being sick in themselves, require clever treatment. I provided for his interests and mine in our father’s house, being anxious to escape the curse which Oedipus once uttered against us; of my own free-will I left this land, allowing him to rule the country for one full year, on condition that I should then take up the rule in turn, instead of plunging into deadly enmity with this man, doing others harm and suffering it myself, as is now the case. But he, after consenting to this and calling the gods to witness his oath, has performed none of his promises, but is still keeping the sovereignty in his own hands together with my share of our heritage. And now I am ready to take my own and dismiss the army from this land, receiving my house in turn to dwell in, and once more restore it to him for an equal period, instead of ravaging our country and bringing scaling-ladders against the towers, as I shall attempt to do if I do not get my rights. I call the gods to witness that spite of my just dealing in everything I am being unjustly robbed of my country, a most unholy act. I have made my points, mother, without stringing together words to entangle you, but urging a fair case, I think, in the judgment of the wise and the simple. To me, although I was not born and bred in If all were unanimous in their ideas of honor and wisdom, there would be no strife to make men disagree; but, as it is, fairness and equality have no existence in this world beyond the name; there is really no such thing. I will tell you this, mother, without any concealment: I would go to the rising of the stars and the sun, or beneath the earth, if I were able so to do, to win Tyranny, the greatest of the gods. Therefore, mother, I will not yield this blessing to another rather than keep it for myself; for it is cowardly to lose the greater and to win the less. Besides, I am ashamed to think that he should gain his object by coming with arms and ravaging the land; for this would be a disgrace to He ought not to have attempted reconcilement by armed force, mother, for words accomplish everything that even the sword of an enemy might effect. Still, if on any other terms he cares to dwell here, he may; but that I shall never willingly let go. Shall I become his slave, when I can rule? Therefore come fire, come sword! Harness your horses, fill the plains with chariots, for I will not give up my tyranny to him. For if we must do wrong, to do so for tyranny is the fairest cause, but in all else piety should be our aim. One should not speak well on deeds that are not good; for that is not good, but bitter to justice. Eteocles, my child, it is not all evil that attends old age; but experience has something to say wiser than youth. Why, my son, do you so long for Ambition, that worst of deities? Oh, do not; the goddess is unjust; many are the homes and cities once prosperous that she has entered and left, to the ruin of her worshippers; and she is the one you are mad for. It is better, my son, to honor Equality, who always joins friend to friend, city to city, allies to allies; for Equality is naturally lasting among men; but the less is always in opposition to the greater, and begins the dawn of hatred. For it is Equality that has set up for man measures and divisions of weights, and has determined numbers; night’s sightless eye, and radiant sun proceed upon their yearly course on equal terms, and neither of them is envious when it has to yield. Though both sun and night are servants for mortals, you will not be content with your fair share of your heritage and give the same to him? Then where is justice? Why do you honor to excess tyranny, a prosperous injustice, why do you think so much of it? Admiring glances are to be prized? No, that is an empty pleasure. Or do you want to have many troubles from the many riches in your house? What advantage is it? The name only; for the wise find what suffices to be enough. Mortals indeed have no possessions of their own; we hold the management of the gods’ property; and when they will, they take it back again. Come, suppose I put before you two alternatives, and ask you whether you wish to rule or save your city? Will you say you wish to rule? Again, if this man conquers you brutally dishonored by men of the enemy. Then that wealth you seek to have will become grievous to That I say to you; and this to you, Polyneices; Adrastus has conferred a foolish favor on you; and you too have shown little sense in coming to lay your city waste. Suppose you conquer this land—may it not happen!—tell me, by the gods, how will you set up a trophy to Zeus? How will you begin the sacrifice after your country’s conquest or inscribe the spoils at the streams of Inachus: Some one will be sure to say: You are eager for two evils, my son, the loss of those there and ruin in the midst of your efforts here. Lay aside your violence, my sons, lay it aside; two men’s follies, once they meet, result in very deadly mischief. O gods, avert these troubles and reconcile the sons of Oedipus! Mother, it is no longer a contest of words; the time we still delay is idle waste; your good wishes accomplish nothing; for we can never be reconciled except upon the terms already named, that I should keep the scepter and be king of this land. Cease these tedious warnings and let me be. Who will kill me? Who is so invulnerable as to plunge a murderous sword in my body without getting for himself the same fate? He is near, not far away. Do you see my hands? I see them; but wealth is cowardly, a craven too fond of life. Then did you come to battle with so many against a man worth nothing? Yes, for a steadfast general is better than a bold one. Relying on the truce, which saves your life, you turn boaster. And so do you; once more I demand back my scepter and share of the land. I admit no demand; I will live in my own house. And keep more than your share? Yes. Leave the country! O altars of my fathers’ gods— Which you are here to destroy. Hear me— Who would hear you after you have marched against your fatherland? And temples of the gods who ride on white horses— And who hate you. I am being driven from my country— Yes, for you came to destroy it. Unjustly, O gods! Call on the gods at You have become unholy— But I have not, like you, become my country’s enemy. By driving me out without my portion. I will kill you in addition. O father, do you you hear what I am suffering? Yes, and he hears what you are doing. And you, mother? It is not lawful for you to mention your mother. O my city! Go to I will; do not be troubled; but I thank you, mother. Go forth from the land! I will go; but let me see my father. You will not have your wish. At least then my maiden sisters. You will not ever see them either. Ah, my sisters! Why do you, their bitterest enemy, call on them? To you at least farewell, mother! Indeed I am faring well, my son! I am no longer your son. I was born to great sorrow. Because my brother treats me outrageously. I am treated just the same. Where will you be stationed before the towers? Why do you ask me this? I will set myself against you for your death. I too have the same desire. Woe is me! what will you do, my sons? The event will show. Oh, try to escape your father’s curse! May destruction seize our whole house! Soon my sword will be busy, plunged in gore. But I call my native land and the gods to witness, with what dishonor and bitter treatment I am being driven forth, as though I were a slave, not a son of Oedipus as much as he. If anything happens to you, my city, blame him, not me; for I did not come willingly, and unwillingly I am driven from the land. And you, Phoebus, lord of highways, and my home, farewell, and my comrades, and statues of the gods, where sheep are sacrificed. For I do not know if I can ever again address you; though hope is not yet asleep, which makes me confident that with the gods’ help I shall slay him and rule this land of Get out of the country! It was a true name our father gave you, when, prompted by some god, he called you Polyneices, man of many quarrels. Cadmus of untamed heifer threw itself down, fulfilling an oracle, where the god’s prophecy told him to make his home in the plains rich with wheat, and where the lovely waters of Dirce pour over the fields, the green and deep-seeded fields; here Bromius’ mother gave birth from her union with Zeus; Bromius, round whom the ivy twined its wreaths while he was still a baby, covering him and blessing him in the shades of its green foliage, a Bacchic dance for the maids and wives inspired in There was Ares’ murderous dragon, a savage guard, watching with wandering eye the watery rivers and fresh streams. Cadmus destroyed it with a jagged stone, when he came there to draw lustral water; smiting the deadly head with a blow of his beast-slaying arm; and by the counsel of from which the earth brought forth a sight fully-armed, above the surface of the soil; but grim slaughter once again united them to the earth they loved, bedewing with blood the ground that had shown them to the sunlit breath of heaven. And you, Epaphus, born from Io, our first mother, and child of Zeus: you I summon in foreign cry, oh! in foreign prayers: come, come to this land; your descendants settled here; and the goddesses of twofold name, Persephone and the kindly goddess Demeter the queen of all, Earth the nurse of all, won it for themselves; send to the help of this land those torch-bearing goddesses; for to gods all things are easy. Go, bring Creon, son of Menoeceus, the brother of Jocasta my mother; tell him I want to consult with him on matters public and private, before we set out to battle and the arrangement of the army. But he is here, saving you the trouble; I see him on his way to my house. I have been everywhere, lord Eteocles, in my desire to see you, and have gone all round the gates and sentinels of And I wanted to see you, Creon; for I found the terms of peace far from satisfactory, when I came to confer with Polyneices. I hear that he has wider aims than I have come to tell you our chief obstacle. What is that? I do not understand what you say. Someone has come who was captured from the Argives. What news does he bring from there? He says the In that case the city of Cadmus must lead out its army. Where? Are you so young that your eyes do not see what they should? Across those trenches, to fight at once. Our forces are small, while theirs are plentiful. I know well they are brave in argument. Never fear! I will soon fill the plain with their dead. I could wish it so; but I see great difficulties in this. I will not keep my army within the walls. And yet victory is entirely a matter of good counsel. Do you then want me to turn to some other way? Yes, to every one, before running the risk once for all. Suppose we fall on them by night from ambush? Yes, if in the event of defeat you can return safely here. Night equalizes risks, though it rather favors daring. The darkness of night is a terrible time to suffer disaster. Well, shall I attack them as they sit at dinner? That might cause them fright, but victory is what we need. Dirce’s ford is certainly deep enough to prevent their retreat. No plan so good as to keep well guarded. What if we ride out against the army of Their troops too are fenced all round with chariots. What shall I do, then? Am I to surrender the city to the enemy? No indeed! But out of your wisdom form some plan. What forethought is wiser than mine? They have seven men, I hear— What is their appointed task? their might is small. . . .  To attack the seven gates. What are we to do then? I will not wait till every chance is gone. You also choose seven men to set against them at the gates. To lead our companies, or to fight single-handed? To lead; choose the very bravest ones. I understand; to repel attempts at scaling our walls. With others to share the command, for one man doesn’t see everything. Selecting them for courage or thoughtful prudence? Both; for one is nothing without the other. It shall be done; I will go to our seven towers and post captains at the gates, as you say, pitting them man for man against the enemy. To tell each one’s name is a great waste of time, when the enemy are camped beneath our very walls. But I will go, that my hands may no longer hang idle. And may I find my brother face to face, meet him in battle and kill him with my spear I ratify their previous betrothal. You are my mother’s brother, no need to speak at length. Take care of her as she deserves, both for your own sake and mine. As for my father, he has been guilty of folly against himself in putting out his eyes; I have small praise for him; by his curses it may be that he will slay us too. One thing we still have to do: ask Teiresias, the seer, if he has anything to say of heaven’s will. I will send your son Menoeceus, who bears your father’s name, to fetch Teiresias here, Creon; for he will readily converse with you, but I have before now so scorned his prophetic art to his face, that he has reasons to reproach me. This commandment, Creon, I lay upon the city and you: if my cause should prevail, never give Polyneices’ corpse a grave in Theban soil, and let the one who buries him die, even if it is a friend. so that I may start at once for the appointed combat, with justice to lead to victory. We will pray to Caution, the most useful goddess, to save our city. O Ares, god of much suffering! Why, why are you possessed by a love of blood and death, out of harmony with the festivals of Bromius? Not for young girls crowned in the lovely dance do you toss your curls, singing to the flute’s breath a song to charm the dancers’ feet; no, with warriors clad in armor you inspire the for Theban blood, leading your revels that are held without music. Nor do you rush with wild waving of the thyrsus, clad in fawnskin, but with chariots and horses you go to the waters of Ismenus, inspiring the Argives with hatred for the Spartans, arraying in bronze armor against these stone-built walls a band of warriors and their shields. Truly Strife is a goddess to fear, who devised these troubles for the princes of this land, for the much-suffering sons of Labdacus. O snow-capped Cithaeron, dear to Artemis, holy vale of leaves, crowded with wild animals, would that you had never reared the one exposed to die, Oedipus, Jocasta’s child, when as a baby he was cast forth from his home, marked with a  golden brooch; and would that the Sphinx, that winged maid, monster from the hills, had never come as a grief to our land with her inharmonious songs, she that once drew near our walls and snatched the sons of Cadmus away in her taloned feet to the untrodden light of heaven, sent by Hades from hell to plague the men of nor can there be good in unlawful children, their mother’s birth pangs, their father’s pollution; she came to the bed of her son. . . . O Earth, you once bore—as I heard, I heard the story told by foreigners once in my own home—you bore a race which sprang of the teeth of a snake with blood-red crest, that fed on beasts, to be the glory and reproach of In days gone by the sons of heaven came to the wedding of Harmonia, and the walls and towers of in the midst between the double streams where Dirce waters the grass-green field before Ismenus; and Io, our horned ancestress, was mother of the kings of thus our city, through an endless succession of various blessings, has set herself upon the heights, crowned with the glory of war.  to my blind feet, as a star is to sailors; lead my steps on to level ground; then go before, so that I do not stumble, for your father has no strength; keep safe for me in your maiden hand the auguries I took when I observed omens from birds, seated in my holy prophet’s chair. Tell me, Menoeceus, son of Creon, how much further toward the city is it, to your father? For my knees grow weary, I have come a long way and can scarcely go on. Take heart, Teiresias, for you have reached your harbor and are near your friends; take him by the hand, my child; for just as every chariot has to wait for outside help to lighten it, so does the step of old age. Enough; I have arrived; why, Creon, do you summon me so urgently? I have not forgotten that; but first collect your strength and regain your breath, shaking off the fatigue of your journey. I am indeed worn out, for I arrived here only yesterday from the court of the Erechtheidae; they too were at war, fighting with Eumolpus. I gave the victory to Cecrops’ sons, and I received this golden crown, as you see, the first-fruits of the enemy’s spoils. I take your crown of victory as an omen. We, as you know, are exposed to the waves of war with the Danaids, and great is the struggle for For Eteocles I would have closed my lips and refrained from all response, but to you I will speak, since it is your wish to learn. This country, Creon, has been long afflicted, ever since Laius became a father against the will of the gods, begetting hapless Oedipus to be his own mother’s husband. That bloody destruction of his eyes was planned by the gods as an example to and allowing him no freedom, they exasperated the poor sufferer; so he, suffering and disgraced as well, breathed dreadful curses against them. And I, because I left nothing undone or unsaid, incurred the hatred of the sons of Oedipus. But death inflicted by each other’s hands awaits them, Creon; and the many heaps of the slain, some from unless I can persuade one man. The best course was to prevent any child of Oedipus becoming either citizen or king in this land, on the ground that they were under a ban and would overthrow the city. But since evil has the mastery of good, there is one other means of safety; but—for it is unsafe for me to tell, and painful too for those whose fortune it is to supply their city with the saving cure—I will go away. Farewell; among the rest I will endure what is to come, if I must; for what else can I do? Stay here, old man. Do not catch hold of me. Wait; why do you try to escape? It is your fortune that tries to escape you, not I. Tell me what can save Though you want this now, you will not want it soon. Not wish to save my country? how can that be? Do you really wish to hear it, eagerly? Yes; for where should I show greater zeal? Then you will presently hear my prophetic words. But first I would know for certain where Menoeceus is, who led me here. Here, not far away, but at your side. Let him go far from my prophecies. He is my own son and will be silent as he ought. Do you want me to tell you in his presence? Yes, for he will rejoice to hear the means of safety. Then hear the intent of my oracle; What do you mean? What is this you have said, old man? I have said what is, and you must do it. O great evil, spoken so briefly! Evil to you, but to your country great salvation. I did not hear; I never listened; I renounce my city! The man is no longer himself; he is drawing back. Go in peace; it is not your prophecy I need. Is truth dead, because you are unfortunate? By your knees and gray hair— Why implore me? You are demanding evils that are hard to prevent. Be silent; do not tell the city your news. You bid me to act unjustly; I cannot be silent. What will you do to me? Kill my child? That is for others to decide; it is for me to speak. How did this curse come on me and my son? You do right to ask me and to test what I have said. In the chamber where the earth-born dragon kept watch over Dirce’s springs, he must be offered as a sacrifice and shed his blood on the ground, a libation of Cadmus, because of the ancient wrath of Ares, who now avenges the slaughter of his earth-born snake. If you do this, you shall win Ares as an ally. If the earth receives fruit for fruit and human blood for blood, you shall find her kind to you again, who once sent up to us a crop of Sown-men with golden helmets; for one of those born from the dragon’s teeth must die. Now you are our only survivor of the Sown race, pure-blooded both on your mother’s and your father’s side, you and your sons. Haemon’s marriage holds him back from the slaughter, for he is no longer single; even if he has not consummated his marriage, yet he is betrothed. But this tender youth, consecrated to his city, might by dying rescue his country; and bitter will he make the return of Adrastus and his Argives, flinging over their eyes a black spirit of death, and he will glorify Now you have all that I had to say. Daughter, lead me home. The man who practices the prophet’s art is a fool; for if he happens to give an adverse answer, he makes himself disliked by those for whom he takes the omens; while if he pities and deceives those who are consulting him, he wrongs the gods. Phoebus should have been man’s only prophet, for he fears no one. Creon, why are you so silent, without a word? I too am no less amazed. What can one say? It is clear what my words must be. For I will never come to such misfortune as to devote my son to death for the city; for all men love their children, and no one would give his own son to die. Let no man praise me, and kill my child at the same time. I myself, for I am in the prime of life, am ready to die to save my country. But come, my son, before the whole city learns this, fly with all haste away from this land, regardless of these prophets’ reckless warnings; for he will tell all this to our rulers and generals now if we can forestall him, you are saved, but if you are too late, we are ruined and you will die. Where can I escape? To what city? To which of our guest-friends? Where you will be furthest removed from this land. It is for you to name a place, for me to carry out your bidding. After passing Where must I go, father? To And where must I go from there? To the land of To You understand. What protection will I find there? The god will send you on your way. How shall I find the means? I will supply you with money. A good plan of yours, father. Go now; for I will come to your sister, Jocasta, at whose breast I was suckled when bereft of my mother, a lonely orphan, Come, come! be going; it isn’t your part to hinder me. How cleverly, ladies, I banished my father’s fears by crafty words to gain my end; for he is trying to get me away, depriving the city of its chance and surrendering me to cowardice. Though an old man may be pardoned, yet in my case there is no pardon for betraying the country that gave me birth. Know this, I will go and save the city, and give my life up for this land. For it is shameful: those whom no oracles bind and who have not come under divine necessity, stand there, shoulder to shoulder, with no fear of death, and fight for their country before her towers; while I leave the land like a coward, a traitor to my father and brother and city; wherever I live, I shall seem base. No, by Zeus and all his stars, by Ares, god of blood, who established the Sown-men that sprung one day from earth as lords of this land! I will go, and standing on the topmost battlements, will sacrifice myself over the dragon’s deep, dark den, the spot the seer described, and will set my country free. I have spoken. Now I go to make the city a present of my life, no mean offering, to rid this kingdom of its affliction. For if each were to take and expend all the good within his power, contributing it to the common good of his country, our states would experience fewer troubles and would prosper for the future. You came, you came, O winged creature, born of earth and hellish viper, to prey upon the sons of Cadmus, full of death, full of sorrow, half a maiden, a murderous monster, with roving wings and ravening claws; you once caught up youths from the haunts of Dirce, with discordant song, and you brought, you brought a murderous grief, a deadly curse to our native land. A deadly god he was who brought all this to pass. Mourning of mothers, mourning of maidens, filled the houses with groans; a lamenting cry, a lamenting song, one after another wailed out, in turn throughout the city. The roar of the groaning was like thunder, whenever the winged maiden bore a man out of sight from the city. At last came Oedipus, the man of sorrow, sent from to this land of polluting the city; and striking down his sons by his curses, he handed them over to loathsome strife, through blood, the wretched man. We admire him, we admire him, who has gone to his death in his country’s cause, leaving tears to Creon, but bringing a crown of victory to our seven fenced towers. May we be mothers in this way, may we have such fair children, dear PalIas, you who with well-aimed stone spilled the serpent’s blood, rousing Cadmus to brood upon the task, from which a demon’s curse swooped upon this land and ravaged it. Ho there! Who is at the palace-gates? Open the door, summon Jocasta forth. Ho there! once again I call; in spite of this long delay, come forth; listen, noble wife of Oedipus, cease your lamentation and your tears of woe. Surely you have not come, dear friend, with the sad news of Eteocles’ death, beside whose shield you have always marched, warding off from him the enemy’s darts? He is alive, do not fear that, so that I may rid you of your terror. Well? How is it with the seven towers that wall us in? They stand unshattered; the city is not plundered. Have they been in jeopardy of the Yes, on the very brink; but our Theban warriors proved stronger than One thing tell me, by the gods, if you know anything of Polyneices; for this too is my concern, if he is alive. As yet your sons are living, the pair of them. God bless you! How did you succeed in beating off from our gates the After Creon’s son, who gave up his life for his country, had taken his stand on the turret’s top and plunged a dark-hilted sword through his throat to save this land, your son told off seven companies with their captains to the seven gates to keep watch on the and stationed cavalry to cover cavalry, and infantry to support infantry, so that assistance might be close at hand for any weak point in the walls. Then from our lofty towers we saw the Teumesus, and, when near the trench, they charged up to our Theban city at a run. In one loud burst from their ranks and from our walls rang out the battle-cry and trumpet-call. First to the Neitian gate, Parthenopaeus, son of the huntress, led a company bristling with thick rows of shields, and he had his own device in the centre of his shield: Atalanta slaying the Aetolian boar with an arrow shot from far. To the gates of Proetus came the prophet Amphiaraus, bringing the victims on a chariot; he had no boastful sign, but weapons chastely plain. Next lord Hippomedon came marching to the Ogygian gates with this device in the middle of his shield: Argus the all-seeing dappled with eyes on the watch, some open with the rising stars, others hiding when they set, as could be seen after he was slain. At the Homoloian gates Tydeus had his post, a lion’s skin with shaggy mane upon his shield, while the Titan Prometheus bore a torch in his right hand, to fire the town. Your own Polyneices led the battle against the Fountain gate; upon his shield for a device were the colts of At Electra’s gate Capaneus brought up his company, bold as Ares for the battle; this device his shield bore upon its iron back: an earth-born giant carrying on his shoulders a whole city which he had wrenched from its base, a hint to us of the fate in store for Adrastus was at the seventh gate; a hundred vipers engraved on his shield, as I carried the watch-word along to the leaders of our companies. To begin with, we fought with bows and thonged javelins, with slings that shoot from far and crashing stones; and as we were conquering, Tydeus and your son suddenly cried aloud: and many of us you could have seen thrown to the earth like tumblers before the walls, breathing their last, bedewing the dry ground with streams of blood. Then Atalanta’s son, who was not an fire and picks to raze the town; but Periclymenus, son of the ocean-god, stayed his wild career, heaving on his head a wagon-load of stone, the coping from the battlements; and it shattered his head with yellow hair and crashed through the seams of the skull, dabbling with blood his fresh cheek; and he will never go back alive to his mother with her lovely bow, the maid of Maenalus. Your son then, seeing these gates secure, went on to the next, and I followed him. I saw Tydeus and his thick rows of targeteers hurling their Aetolian spears into the opening at the top of the turrets, so that our men fled and left the battlements; but your son rallied them once more, as a huntsman cheers his hounds, and stationed them at the towers again. And then we hastened to other gates, after stopping the affliction there. As for the madness of Capaneus, how can I describe it? He was going about with a long scaling-ladder, and boasting that even the holy fire of Zeus would not hold him back from giving the city to utter destruction. And even as he spoke, he climbed up beneath the hail of stones, crouched under the shelter of his shield, rung by smooth rung going up the ladder. But, just as he was scaling the parapet of the wall, Zeus smote him with a thunderbolt; the earth re-echoed, and fear seized everyone; for from the ladder But when Adrastus saw that Zeus was hostile to his army, he drew the were driving forth their chariots, and the armed men charged with spears into the middle of the Argives, and all troubles happened at once: men were dying, hurled headlong from chariots, wheels flew off, axles crashed together, while the dead were heaped up on the dead. So for to-day we have prevented destruction of the towers of our land; but if this land will be fortunate for the future, that rests with the gods; for even now it owes its safety to some deity. Victory is fair; and if the gods are growing kinder, it would be well with me. The gods and fortune have treated us well; for my sons are alive and my land has escaped ruin. But Creon seems to have had bitter enjoyment from my marriage with Oedipus, by losing his son to his sorrow, a public success, a private grief. But please, come back to your tale again and say what my two sons intend to do next. Let the rest be; all is well with you so far. Your words rouse my suspicions; I cannot let it be. Have you any further wish than your sons’ safety? Yes, to hear if I shall fare well in the future. Let me go; your son is left without his squire. There is some evil you are hiding, veiling it in darkness. I would not add ill news to the good you have heard. You must, unless you take wings and fly away. Ah! Why did you not let me go after my good news, instead of forcing me to disclose evil? Those two sons of yours are resolved on deeds of shameful recklessness, a single combat apart from the army; they addressed to Argives and Thebans alike words I would they had never uttered. Eteocles, taking his stand on a lofty tower, after ordering silence to be proclaimed to the army, began: So he spoke; then your son Polyneices rushed from the battle-line and assented to his proposal. And all the Argives and the people of Cadmus shouted their approval, as though they thought it just. On these terms the armies made a truce, and in the space between them the generals took an oath to abide by. At once, the two sons of the old Oedipus were hiding themselves in bronze armor; and lords of while Others to Eteocles: So they spoke, cheering them to the battle. The seers were sacrificing sheep and noting the tongues and forks of fire, the damp reek which is a bad omen, and the tapering flame which gives decisions on two points, being both a sign of victory and defeat. But, if you have any power or subtle speech or charmed spell, go, restrain your children from this terrible combat, for great is the risk they run. The prize of the contest will be grievous sorrow for you, if to-day you are deprived of both your sons. Antigone, my daughter, come out of the house; this heaven-sent crisis is no time for dances or girlish pursuits. But you and your mother must prevent two brave men, your own brothers, from plunging into death and falling by each other’s hand. Mother, what new terror are you proclaiming to your friends before the palace? Daughter, your brothers’ lives are going to ruin. What do you mean? They have resolved on single combat. Oh no! what do you have to say, mother? No welcome news; follow me. Where, away from my maiden’s chamber? To the army. I cannot face the crowd. Coyness is not for you now. But what shall I do? You will put an end to your brothers’ strife. How so, mother? By falling at their knees with me. Lead on till we are between the armies; we must not delay. Haste, my daughter, haste! For, if I can forestall the onset of my sons, I may yet live; but if they are dead, I will lie down in death with them. Alas, alas! My mind is trembling with fear, trembling; and through my flesh goes a throb of pity, of pity for the hapless mother. Which of her two sons will stain the other with blood— ah, for the suffering! O Zeus, O earth, alas!—a brother’s throat, a brother’s life, through his shield, through his blood? Ah me! ah me! which of them will I lament as dead? Ah, the earth! Ah, the earth! Twin savage beasts, two murderous souls with brandished spears will soon be draining the fallen, fallen enemy’s blood. Unhappy, that they ever thought of single combat! In foreign voice I will chant a dirge of tears and wailing, in mourning for the dead. Close to murder stands their fortune; the coming day will decide it. Fatal this slaughter, fatal, because of the Furies. But hark! I see Creon on his way here to the house with clouded brow, and so I will cease my present lamentations. Ah me! what shall I do? Am I to mourn with tears myself or my city, which has a cloud around it His body I have just now taken from the dragon’s rocky lair and sadly carried the self-slain victim here in my arms; and the house is filled with weeping; but now I have come for my sister Jocasta, age seeking age, that she may bathe my child’s corpse and lay it out. For those who are not dead must reverence the god below by paying honor to the dead. Your sister, Creon, has gone out, and her daughter Antigone went with her. Where did she go? What happened? Tell me. She heard that her sons were about to engage in single combat for the royal house. What do you mean? In my tenderness to my dead son, I was not able to learn this. It is some time, Creon, since your sister’s departure, and I expect the struggle for life and death is already decided by the sons of Oedipus. Alas! I see a sign there, the gloomy look and face of the messenger coming to tell us the whole matter. Ah, woe is me! What story can I tell, what lament can I make? We are lost; your opening words have no fair appearance. Ah, woe is me! I say again; for I am bringing great horrors. In addition to the other sorrowful deeds. What is your tale? Your sister’s sons are now no more, Creon. Alas! you have a great tale of woe for me and the city. O house of Oedipus, have you heard these tidings of sons slain by the same fate? A tale to make it weep, if it were endowed with sense. Oh! most grievous stroke of fate! If you only know the sorrows other than those! How can they be more hard to bear than these? Your sister has died, with her two sons. Loudly, loudly raise the wail, and with white hands strike upon your heads! Oh, wretched Jocasta! what an end to life and marriage you have found the riddling of the Sphinx! Tell me how her two sons accomplished the bloody deed, the struggle caused by the curse of Oedipus. Of our successes before the towers you know, for the walls are not far away the young sons of the old Oedipus, had adorned themselves in their bronze armor, they went and took their stand between the armies, But Eteocles, looking towards the temple of Pallas with the golden shield, prayed: When the Tuscan trumpet, like a torch, blew the signal for the bloody battle, they darted wildly against one another; like boars whetting their savage tusks, they joined battle, their beards wet with foam. They kept shooting out their spears, but crouched beneath their shields to let the steel glance off in vain; but if either saw the other’s eye above the rim, he would aim his lance there, eager to outwit him with the point. But both kept such careful outlook through the spy-holes in their shields, that their weapons found nothing to do; while from the onlookers far more than the combatants trickled the sweat caused by terror for their friends. the Danaid army, one and all, cried out for joy. And the wounded man, seeing Polyneices’ shoulder bare in this effort, plunged his spear with all his might into his breast, restoring gladness to the citizens of And so, at a loss for a weapon, he retreated step by step, till catching up a splintered rock he let it fly and broke the other’s spear in the middle; and now the combat was equal, for each had lost his lance. Then clutching their sword-hilts they closed, and round and round, with shields clashing, they fought a wild battle. And Eteocles introduced the crafty Thessalian trick, having some knowledge of it from his association with that country. Disengaging himself from the immediate contest, he drew back his left foot but kept his eye closely on the pit of the other’s stomach from a distance; then advancing his right foot he plunged the weapon through his navel and fixed it in his spine. Down fell Polyneices, dripping with blood, ribs and belly contracting in his agony. But the other, thinking his victory now complete, threw down his sword and began to despoil him, wholly intent on that, without a thought for himself. And this indeed tripped him up; for Polyneices, who had fallen first, was still faintly breathing, and having in his grievous fall kept his sword, he made a last effort and drove it through the heart of Eteocles. They both lie there, fallen side by side, biting the dust with their teeth, and they have not decided the mastery. Ah, ah, how I mourn for your sorrows, Oedipus! The god, it seems, has fulfilled those curses of yours. Now hear what further woes succeeded. Just as her two sons had fallen and lay dying, their wretched mother came on the scene, her daughter with her, in great haste. When she saw their mortal wounds, she wailed: and though he could not say a word, his moistened eye was eloquent to prove his love. And Polyneices was still breathing, and seeing his sister and his old mother he said: So both at once breathed out their life of sorrow. But when their mother saw this sad event, in her overmastering grief she snatched a sword from the dead, and did a fearful deed; for she drove the steel right through her throat, and there she lies, dead with those she loved so well, her arms thrown round them both. The army sprang to their feet and fell to wrangling, we maintaining that victory rested with my master, they with theirs; and there was strife among the generals, some holding that Polyneices gave the first wound with his spear, others that, as both were dead, victory rested with neither. Meanwhile Antigone crept away from the army. They rushed to their weapons, but by some lucky forethought the people of Cadmus had sat down under arms; and by a sudden attack we surprised the Not one withstood our onset, and they filled the plain with fugitives, while blood was streaming from the countless dead our spears had slain. When victory had crowned our warfare, some set up an image of Zeus as a trophy, others were stripping the and sending their spoils inside the battlements; and others with Antigone are bringing the dead here for their friends to mourn. So for the city, the result of this struggle hovers between the two extremes of good and evil fortune. No longer do the misfortunes of this house extend to hearsay only; three corpses of the slain lie here at the palace for all to see; by one common death they have drawn their lot, a life of darkness. I do not veil my tender cheek shaded with curls, nor do I feel shame, from maiden modesty, at the dark red beneath my eyes, the blush upon my face, as I hurry on, in bacchic revelry for the dead, casting from my hair its mantle and letting my delicate saffron robe fly loose, a tearful escort to the dead. Ah me! Oh, Polyneices! you were rightly named, after all; woe to you, Your strife—not strife, but murder on murder— has brought the house of Oedipus to ruin with dire and grim bloodshed. What harmonious or tuneful wailing can I summon, for my tears, my tears, oh, my home! oh, my home! as I bear these three kindred bodies, my mother and her sons, a welcome sight to the Fury? She destroyed the house of Oedipus, root and branch, when his shrewdness solved the Sphinx’s unsolvable song and killed that savage singer. Alas for you, father! What other Hellene or barbarian, what mortal from a noble line ever endured the anguish of such visible afflictions? Ah! poor girl, how piteous is your cry! What bird, perched on the high-leaved branches of oak or pine, will come to mourn with me, left motherless? With cries of woe, I lament before it comes the piteous lonely life, that I shall live for the rest of time, in streaming tears. On which of these shall I throw my offerings first, plucking the hair from my head? on the breast of the mother that suckled me, or beside the ghastly death-wounds of my brothers’ corpses? Oh, oh! Oedipus, my old father with sightless eyes, leave your house, reveal the misery of your life, you who have cast a mist of darkness over your eyes and draw out a weary existence within the house. Do you hear, you who are wandering with old step across the court, or sleeping on your wretched pallet couch? Why, daughter, have you dragged me to the light by your piteous tears, supporting my blind footsteps, from the gloom of my bed-chamber, gray-haired, invisible as a phantom of the air, or as a spirit from the world below, or as a dream that flies? Father, there are tidings of sorrow for you to bear; no longer do your sons see the light, or your wife, who would always labor to tend your blind footsteps as with a staff. Alas for you, my father! Alas for my sorrows! I may well groan and cry. Three lives! Tell me, child, by what fate they left the light. I do not say this to reproach or mock you, but in sadness: your own avenging curse, with all its load of swords and fire and ruthless war, came on your sons. Alas for you, my father! Ah me! Why that groan? My sons! You are in pain; but if you could look towards the sun-god’s four-horse chariot and turn the light of your eyes on these corpses— The evil fate of my sons is clear; but she, my poor wife, tell me, daughter, by what fate did she die? All saw her weep and heard her moan, as she rushed forth to carry to her sons her last appeal, a mother’s breast. But the mother found her sons at the Electran gate, in a meadow where the lotus blooms, fighting out their duel with spears, like lions in their lair, eager to wound each other, a murderous libation of blood already cold, owed to Hades, poured out by Ares. Then, taking from the dead a sword of hammered bronze, she plunged it in her flesh, and in sorrow for her sons fell with her arms around them. So the god who fulfills these sorrows has brought them all together on this day, father, for our house. Today is the beginning of many troubles to the house of Oedipus; may he live to be more fortunate! Cease now your lamentations; it is time we thought of their burial. Hear what I have to say, Oedipus. Eteocles, your son, left me to rule this land, by giving it as a dowry to Haemon with his marriage to your daughter Antigone. Therefore I will no longer allow you to dwell in this land; for Teiresias clearly said that the city would never prosper as long as you made your home here. So begone! And I say this not in insult, nor because I am your enemy, but from fear that some calamity will come upon the land, through those avenging fiends of yours. O destiny! From the beginning, how you have created me wretched and unhappy, if any mortal ever was; for before I had left my mother’s womb and seen the light, Apollo foretold to Laius that I, then unborn, should become my father’s murderer; alas for me! So, as soon as I was born, the father who begot me tried to kill me, thinking me his enemy, for it was fated he should die at my hand; so he sent me unweaned to make a pitiful meal for beasts; I escaped from that— would that Cithaeron had sunk into hell’s yawning abyss, because it did not destroy me, but . . .  Fate made me a slave in the service of Polybus. And I, poor wretch, after slaying my own father came to my mother’s bed, to her sorrow, and begot sons that were my brothers, whom I have destroyed, by bequeathing to them the legacy of curses I received from Laius. For I was not born so foolish, that I should have contrived these things against my own eyes and my children’s life, without some god. Let that pass. What am I, poor wretch, to do? Who now will be my guide and tend the blind man’s step? The one who is dead? If she were alive, I know well that she would. My pair of noble sons? But they are gone from me. But am I still so young myself that I can find a livelihood? Where? O Creon, why do you seek in this way to kill me utterly? For you will kill me, if you banish me from the land. Yet I will never twine my arms about your knees and seem a coward, for I would not betray my former nobility, no! not for all my ills. You have spoken well, in refusing to touch my knees, but I could not allow you to dwell in the land. Of these dead, bear one at once to the palace; but the other, who came with strangers to sack his native town, the dead Polyneices, cast forth unburied beyond the borders of this land. To all the race of Cadmus shall this be proclaimed: As for you, Antigone, leave your mourning for these lifeless three and go indoors, to lead your maiden life until to-morrow, when Haemon waits to marry you. O father, in what cruel misery are we plunged! For you I mourn more than for the dead; for in your woes you do not have something that is grievous and something not; but you were born wholly unfortunate, father. As for you, new-made king, I ask you, who do you insult my father with banishment? Why do you make laws over a helpless corpse? This was Eteocles’ purpose, not mine. It is senseless, and you are a fool to obey it! How so? Isn’t it right to carry out his commands? No; not if they are wrong and ill-advised. What? Isn’t it right for that other to be given to the dogs? No, for the vengeance you are exacting is not a lawful one. Yes, if he was his country’s enemy, when not born an enemy. Well, he rendered up his destiny to fate. Let him now pay the penalty in his burial too. What crime did he commit, in coming to claim his portion of the land? Be very sure of this, he shall have no burial. I will bury him, although the state forbids. Do so, and you will be making your own grave by his. A noble end, for two so near and dear to lie side by side! Seize and take her inside. Oh, no! For I will not let go of this corpse. These are the god’s decrees, my girl, not what seems good to you. And this has been decreed, not to insult the dead. Be sure that no one will sprinkle over the corpse the moistened dust. O Creon, by my mother Jocasta, I implore you! Your labor is in vain; you will not gain your prayer. Let me only bathe the dead body. That would be part of what is forbidden by the city. At least let me bandage the cruel wounds. No; you will never pay honor to this corpse. O my dearest! At least I will kiss your mouth. Do not let this mourning bring disaster on your marriage. Marriage! Do you think I will marry your son while I am alive? Indeed you must; how will you escape the match? Then that night will find in me another Danaid bride! Do you see how boldly she reproaches me? Let the steel know, the sword be my witness! Why are you so eager to be released from this marriage? I mean to share my hapless father’s exile. A noble spirit yours but there is some folly in it. And I will share his death, I tell you further. Go, leave the land; you will not murder my son. Daughter, for this loyal spirit I thank you. How could I marry, while you went into exile alone, father? Stay here and be happy; I will bear my own load of sorrow. And who will tend you in your blindness, father? Where fate appoints, there I will fall and lie down upon the ground. Where is Oedipus, and that famous riddle? Lost! One day blessed me, one destroyed me. May I not also share your sorrows? To wander with her blinded father would be shameful for his daughter. Not so, father, but glory, if she is discreet. Lead me near, so that I may touch your mother’s corpse. There, embrace the aged form so dear to you. O mother, o most wretched wife! Pitiably she lies, who suffered every evil at once. Where are the corpses of Eteocles, and of Polyneices? Here they both lie, stretched out side by side. Lay my blind hand upon their poor faces. There, touch the dead, your children. O dear fallen sons, sad offspring of a sad father! O my brother Polyneices, name most dear to me! Now the oracle of Loxias is being fulfilled, my child. What oracle? Do you have further woes to tell? That I should die in Where? What fenced town in Hallowed Go to unhappy exile; stretch forth your dear hand, my old father, taking me to guide you, like a breeze that guides the ships. See, I am advancing; be my guide, my poor child. I am, I am! The saddest maiden of all in Where am I placing my aged step? Bring my staff, child. This way, this way, come to me, place your steps here, like a dream in your strength. Oh, oh, driving the old man in most wretched flight from the country! Oh, oh! the terrible sorrows I have endured! Why do you speak of enduring? Justice does not see the wicked, and does not requite follies. I am the one who came into high songs of victory, because I guessed the baffling riddle of the girl, half-maiden. You are bringing up again the reproach of the Sphinx. Talk no more of past success. This misery was in store for you all the while, to become an exile from your country and die anywhere. Leaving to my girlhood friends sad tears, I go forth from my native land, to roam as no maiden should. Ah! This dutiful resolve towards my father’s suffering will make me famous. Alas for the insults heaped on you and on my brother, whose dead body goes from the house unburied, poor boy! I will bury him secretly, though I have to die for it, father. Show yourself to your companions. My own laments suffice. Go pray at the altars. They have enough of my piteous tale. At least go seek the Bromian god in his untrodden sanctuary among the Maenads’ hills. Bromius, for whom I once dressed in the Theban fawn-skin and danced upon the hills in the holy choir of Semele—shall I now offer the gods homage that is not homage? O citizens of a famous country, look at me; I am Oedipus, who solved the famous riddle, and was the greatest of men, I, who alone controlled the murderous Sphinx’s power, am now myself driven from the land in dishonor and misery. But why do I make this moan and useless lamentation? As a mortal, I must bear the constraint that the gods decree. Greatly revered Victory, may you occupy my life and never cease to crown me!  \n",

this Eleusinian land, and ye servants of the goddess who attend her fane, grant happiness to me and my son Theseus, to the city of wherein my father reared me, Aethra, in a happy home, and gave me in marriage to Aegeus, Pandion’s son, according to the oracle of Loxias. This prayer I make, when I behold these aged dames, who, leaving their homes in now throw themselves with suppliant branches at my knees in their awful trouble; for around the gates of Cadmus have they lost their seven noble sons, whom on a day Adrastus, king of eager to secure for exiled Polynices, his son-in-law, a share in the heritage of Oedipus; so now their mothers would bury in the grave the dead, whom the spear hath slain, but the victors prevent them and will not allow them to take up the corpses, spurning Heaven’s laws. Here lies Adrastus on the ground with streaming eye, sharing with them the burden of their prayer to me, and bemoaning the havoc of the sword and the sorry fate of the warriors whom he led from their homes. And he doth urge me use entreaty, to persuade my son to take up the dead and help to bury them, either by winning words or force of arms, laying on my son and on at this shrine, where first the fruitful corn showed its bristling shocks above the soil. And here at the holy altars of the twain goddesses, Demeter and her daughter, I wait, holding these childless mothers, hoary with age, and from reverence for the sacred fillets. To call Theseus hither is my herald to the city gone, that he may rid the land of that which grieveth them, or loose these my suppliant bonds, with pious observance of the gods’ will; for such as are discreet amongst women should in all cases invoke the aid of men. At thy knees I fall, aged dame, and my old lips beseech thee; arise, rescue from the slain my children’s bodies, whose limbs, by death relaxed, are left a prey to savage mountain beasts, beholding the bitter tears which spring to my eyes and my old wrinkled skin torn by my hands; for what can I do else? who never laid out my children dead within my halls, nor now behold their tombs heaped up with earth. Thou too, honoured lady, once a son didst bear, crowning thy lord’s marriage with fond joy; then share, O share with me thy mother’s feelings, in such measure as my sad heart grieves for my own dead sons; and persuade thy son, whose aid we implore, to go unto the river Ismenus, there to place within my hapless arms the bodies of my children, slain in their prime and left without a tomb. Though for my cause is just, and ’tis in thy power, blest as thou art in thy children, to remove from me my woe; so in my sore distress I do beseech thee of my misery place in my hands my son’s dead body, that I may throw my arms about his hapless limbs. Behold a rivalry in sorrow! woe takes up the tale of woe; hark! thy servants beat their breasts. Come ye which Hades honours; let the Sorrow’s charm doth drive me wild, insatiate, painful, endless, even as the trickling stream that gushes from some steep rock’s face; for ’tis woman’s way to fall a-weeping o’er the cruel calamity of children dead. Ah me! would I could die and forget my anguish! What is this lamentation that I hear, this beating of the breast, these dirges for the dead, with cries that echo from this shrine? How fluttering fear disquiets me, lest haply my mother have gotten some mischance, in quest of whom I come, for she hath been long absent from home. Ha! what now? A strange sight challenges my speech; I see my aged mother sitting at the altar and stranger dames are with her, who in various note proclaim their woe; from aged eyes the piteous tear is starting to the ground, their hair is shorn, their robes are not the robes of joy. What means it, mother? ’Tis thine to make it plain to me, mine to listen; yea, for I expect some tidings strange. My son, these are the mothers of those chieftains seven, who fell around the gates of Cadmus’ town. With suppliant boughs they keep me prisoner, as thou seest, in their midst. And who is yonder man, that moaneth piteously in the gateway? Adrastus, they inform me, king of Are those his children, those boys who stand round him? Not his, but the sons of the fallen slain. Why are they come to us, with suppliant hand outstretched? I know; but ’tis for them to tell their story, my son. To thee, in thy mantle muffled, I address my inquiries; unveil thy head, let lamentation be, and speak; for naught can be achieved save through the utterance of thy tongue. Victorious prince of the Athenian realm, Theseus, to thee and to thy city I, a suppliant, come. What seekest thou? What need is thine? Dost know how I did lead an expedition to its ruin? Assuredly; thou didst not pass through There I lost the pick of These are the results of that unhappy war. I went and craved their bodies from Didst thou rely on heralds, Hermes’ servants, in order to bury them? I did; and even then their slayers said me nay. Why, what say they to thy just request? Say! Success makes them forget how to bear their\\n        fortune. Art come to me then for counsel? or wherefore? With the wish that thou, O Theseus, shouldst recover the sons of the Argives. Where is your Defeat and ruin are our lot. To thee for aid we come. this thy own private resolve, or the wish of all the city? The sons of Danaus, one and all, implore thee to bury the dead. Why didst lead thy seven armies against To confer that favour on the husbands of my daughters twain. To which of the Argives didst thou give thy daughters in marriage? I made no match for them with kinsmen of my family. What! didst give Argive maids to foreign lords? Yea, to Tydeus, and to Polynices, who was Theban-born. What induced thee to select this alliance? Dark riddles of Phoebus stole away my judgment. What said Apollo to determine the maidens’ marriage? That I should give my daughters twain to a wild boar and a lion. How dost thou explain the message of the god? One night came to my door two exiles. The name of each declare; thou art speaking of both together. They fought together, Tydeus with Polynices. Didst thou give thy daughters to them as to wild beasts? Yea, for, as they fought, I likened them to those monsters twain. Why had they left the borders of their native land and come to thee? Tydeus was exiled for the murder of a kinsman. Wherefore had the son of Oedipus left By reason of his father’s curse, not to spill his brother’s blood. Wise no doubt that voluntary exile. But those who stayed at home were for injuring the absent. What! did brother rob brother of his inheritance? To avenge this I set out; hence my ruin. Didst consult seers, and gaze into the flame of burnt-offerings? Ah me! thou pressest on the very point, wherein I most did fail. It seems thy going was not favoured by heaven. Worse; I went in spite even of Amphiaraus. And so heaven lightly turned I was carried away by the clamour of younger men. Thou didst favour courage instead of discretion. to throw myself upon the ground and clasp thy knees, I a grey-haired king, blest in days gone by; yet needs must I yield to my misfortunes. I pray thee save the dead; have pity on my sorrows and on these, the mothers of the slain, whom hoary eld finds reft of their sons; yet they endured to journey hither and tread a foreign soil with aged tottering steps, bearing no embassy to Demeter’s mysteries; only seeking burial for their dead, which lot should have been theirs, e’en burial by the hands of sons still in their prime. for it turns an eye on suffering, and hath in thee a young and gallant king, for want whereof to lead their hosts states ere now have often perished. I too, Theseus, urge the same plea to thee; have pity on my hard fate. Full οft have I argued out this subject with others. For there are who say, there is more bad than good in human nature, to the which I hold a contrary view, that1 for if it were not so, we should not exist. He hath my praise, whoe’er of gods brought us to live by rule from chaos and from brutishness, first by implanting reason, and next by giving us a tongue to declare our thoughts, so as to2 bestowing fruitful crops, and drops of rain from heaven to make them grow, wherewith to nourish earth’s fruits and to water her lap; and more than this, protection from the wintry storm, and means to ward from us the sun-god’s scorching heat; the art of sailing o’er the sea, so that we might exchange with one another whatso our countries lack. And where sight fails us and our knowledge is not sure, the seer foretells by gazing on the flame, by reading signs in folds of entrails, or by divination from the flight of birds. Are we not then too proud, when heaven hath made such preparation for our life, not to be content therewith? But our presumption seeks to lord it over heaven, and in the pride of our hearts we think we are wiser than the gods. Methinks thou art even of this number, a son of folly, seeing that thou, though obedient to Apollo’s oracle in giving thy daughters to strangers, as if gods really existed, yet hast hurt thy house by mingling the stream of its pure line with muddy waters; no! never should the wise man have joined the stock of just and unjust in one, but should have gotten prosperous friends for his family. For the deity, confusing their destinies, doth oft destroy by the sinner’s fate him who never sinned nor committed injustice. Thou didst lead all though seers proclaimed the will of heaven, and then in scorn of them and in violent disregard of the gods hast ruined thy city, led away by younger men, such as court distinction, and add war to war unrighteously destroying their fellow-citizens; one aspires to lead an army; another fain would seize the reins of power and work his wanton will; a third is bent on gain, careless of any mischief the people thereby suffer. For there are three ranks of citizens; the rich, a useless set, that ever crave for more; the poor and destitute, fearful folk, that cherish envy more than is right, and shoot out grievous stings against the men who have aught, beguiled as they are by the eloquence of vicious leaders; while the class that is midmost of the three preserveth cities, observing such order as the state ordains. Shall I then become thy ally? What fair pretext should I urge before my countrymen? Depart in peace! For why He erred; but with the young men rests this error, while he may well be pardoned. I did not choose thee, king, to judge my affliction, but came I to thee to punish or correct them, but to seek thy help. But if thou wilt not, I must be content with thy decision; for how can I help it? Come, aged dames, away! Yet leave behind you here the woven leaves of pale green foliage, calling to witness heaven and earth, Demeter, that fire-bearing goddess, and the sun-god’s light, that our prayers to heaven availed us naught. . . . . What art thou doing? wilt thou betray these suppliant symbols, and banish from thy land these aged women without the boon they should obtain? Do not so; e’en the wild beast finds a refuge in the rock, the slave in the altars of the gods, and a state when tempest-tossed cowers to its neighbour’s shelter; for naught in this life of man is blest unto its end. Rise, hapless one, from the sacred floor of Persephone; rise, clasp him by the knees and implore him, Ah me! ah me! O pity me as I entreat for my sons with my tale of wretched woe, like as thus I throw me at thy knees to win my children burial. Mother mine, why weepest thou, drawing o’er thine eyes thy veil? Is it because thou didst hear their piteous where thou sittest at the holy altar of Demeter. Ah woe! ’Tis not for thee their sorrows to lament. Ye hapless dames! Thou art not of their company. May I a scheme declare, my son, that shall add to thy glory and the state’s? Yea, for oft even from women’s lips issue wise counsels. Yet the word, that lurks within my heart, makes me hesitate. Shame! to hide from friends good counsel. Nay then, I will not hold my peace to blame myself hereafter for having now kept silence to my shame, nor will I forego my honourable proposal, from the common fear that it is useless for women to give good advice. First, my son, I exhort thee give good heed to heaven’s will, lest from slighting it thou suffer shipwreck; to venture somewhat for injured folk; and this, my son, it is that brings thee now thy honour, and causes me no fear to urge that thou shouldst use perform this bounden duty, and check those who would confound the customs of all when thou mightest have won for thy city a crown of glory, and, though thou didst encounter a savage swine, Nay! do not so if thou be son of mine. Dost see how fiercely thy country looks on its revilers when they mock her for want of counsel? Yea, for in her toils she groweth greater. But states, whose policy is dark and cautious, have their sight darkened by their carefulness. My son, wilt thou not go succour the dead and these poor women in their need? I have no fears for thee, starting as thou dost with right upon thy side; and although I see the prosperity of Cadmus’ folk, still am I confident they will throw a different die; for the deity reverses all things again. Ah! best of friends, right well hast thou pleaded for me and for Adrastus, and hence my joy is doubled. Mother, the words that I have spoken are his fair deserts, and I have declared my opinion of the counsels that ruined him; yet do I perceive the truth of thy warning to me, that it ill suits my character to shun dangers. For by a long and glorious career have I displayed this my habit among Hellenes, of ever punishing the wicked. Wherefore I cannot refuse toil. For what will spiteful tongues say of me, when thou, my mother, who more than all others fearest for my safety, bidst me undertake this enterprise? Yea, I will go about this business and rescue the dead by words persuasive; or, failing that, the spear forthwith shall decide this issue, nor will heaven grudge me this. But I require the whole city’s sanction also, which my mere wish will ensure; still by communicating the proposal to them I shall find the people better disposed. For them I made supreme, when I set this city free, by giving all an equal vote. So I will take Adrastus as a text for what I have to say and go to their assembly, and when I have won them to these views, I will return hither, after collecting a picked band of young Athenians; and then remaining under arms I will send a that I may take her by the hand and conduct her to the house of Aegeus; for a wretched son is he who rewards not his parents by service; for, when he hath conferred on them the best he hath, he in his turn from his own sons receives all such service as he gave to them. O May he reach the goal! yea, and triumph o’er my sorrows, rescuing the gory corpse, the mother’s idol, and making the land of Inachus his friend by helping her. For pious toil is a fair ornament to cities, and carries with it a grace that never wastes away. What will the city decide, I wonder? Will it conclude a friendly truce with me, and shall we obtain burial for our sons? Help, O help, city of Pallas, the mother’s cause, that so they may not pollute the laws of all mankind. Thou, I know, dost reverence right, and to injustice dealest out defeat, a protection at all times to the afflicted.  they may expect my warrior host; for at the sacred fount of Callichorus my army camps in readiness and is being reviewed. Moreover, the city gladly of its own accord undertook this enterprise, when it perceived my wish. Ha! who comes hither to interrupt my speech? A Theban herald, Who is the despot of this land? To whom must I announce the message of Creon, who rules o’er the land of Cadmus, since Eteocles was slain by the hand of his brother Polynices, at the sevenfold gates of Sir stranger, thou hast made a false beginning to thy speech, in seeking here a despot. For this city is not ruled by one man, but is free. The people rule in succession year by year, allowing no preference to wealth, but the poor man shares equally with the rich. Thou givest me here an advantage, as it might be in a game of draughts for the city, whence I come, is ruled by one man only, not by the mob; none there puffs up the citizens with specious words, and for his own advantage twists them this way or that,—one moment dear to them and lavish of his favours, the next a bane to all; and yet by fresh calumnies of others he hides his former failures and escapes punishment. Besides, how shall the people, if it cannot form true judgments, be able rightly to direct the state? Nay, ’tis time, not haste, that affords a better understanding. A poor hind, granted he be not all unschooled, would still be unable from his toil to give his mind to politics. Verily by beguiling with words the populace, though aforetime he was naught. This herald is a clever fellow, a dabbler in the art of talk. But since thou hast thus entered the lists with me, listen awhile, for ’twas thou didst challenge a discussion. Naught is more hostile to a city than a despot; where he is, there are in the first place no laws common to all, but one and And he who chooses to do so gains renown, while he, who hath no wish, remains silent. What greater equality can there be in a city? Again, where the people are absolute rulers of the land, they rejoice in having a reserve of youthful citizens, while a king counts and strives to slay the leading men, all such as he deems discreet, for he feareth for his power. How then can a city remain stable, where one cuts short all What boots it to acquire wealth and livelihood for children, merely if ever my children are to be wedded by violence! This bolt I launch in answer to thy words. Now say, why art thou come? what needest thou of this land? Had not thy city sent thee, to thy cost hadst thou come with thy outrageous utterances; for it is the herald’s duty to tell the message he is bidden and hie him back in haste. Henceforth Look you! how insolent the villains are, when Fortune is kind to them, just as if it would be well with them for ever. Now will I speak. On these disputed points hold thou this view, but I the contrary. So I and all the people of Cadmus forbid thee to admit Adrastus to this land, but if he is here, drive him forth in disregard of the holy suppliant that we and our allies shall raise. Take good thought, nor, angered at my words, because forsooth thou rulest thy city with freedom, return a vaunting answer from in strife, by leading them into excessive rage. For whenso the city has to vote on the question of war, no man ever takes his own death into account, but shifts this misfortune on to his neighbour; but if death had been before their eyes when they were giving their votes, the foe of sorrow, whose joy is in glad throngs of children, and its delight in prosperity. These are the blessings we cast away and wickedly embark on war, man enslaving his weaker brother, and cities following suit. Now thou art helping our foes even after death, trying to rescue and bury those whom their nor should the yawning earth have snatched away the seer, or else allow that gods are right to slay the ungodly. The wise should love their children first, next their parents and country, whose fortunes it behoves them to increase rather than break down. Rashness in a leader, as in a pilot, causeth shipwreck; who knoweth when to be quiet is a wise man. Yea and this too is bravery, even forethought. The punishment Zeus hath inflicted was surely enough; there was no need to heap this wanton insult on us. Abandoned wretch! Peace, Adrastus! say no more; set not thy words before mine, for ’tis not to thee this fellow is come with his message, but to me, and I must answer him. Thy first assertion will I answer first: I am not aware that Creon is my lord and master, or that his power outweigheth mine, that so he should compel nor yet introducing murderous strife, but preserving the law of all and covered them with shame, and now your for our own, but to live our life in, and after that its mother earth must take it back again. Dost think ’tis and keep them from the tomb; for, if this law be enacted, it will strike dismay into the stoutest hearts. And art thou come to cast dire threats at me, while thy own folk are afraid of giving burial to the dead? What is your fear? Think you they will undermine your land in their graves, or that they will beget children in the womb of earth, from whom shall rise an avenger? A silly waste of words, in truth it was, to show your fear of paltry groundless terrors. Go, triflers, learn the lesson of human misery; our life is made up of struggles; some men there be that find their fortune soon, others have to wait, while some at once are blest. Fortune lives a dainty life; to her the wretched pays his court and homage to win her smile; her likewise doth the prosperous man extol, for fear the favouring gale may leave him. These lessons should we take to heart, to bear with moderation, free from wrath, our wrongs, and do naught to hurt a whole city. What then? Let us, who will the pious deed perform, bury the corpses of the slain. Else is the issue clear; I will go and bury them by force. For never shall it be proclaimed through Be of good cheer; for if thou preserve the light of justice, thou shalt escape many a charge that men might urge. Wilt thou that I sum up in brief all thou wouldst say? Say what thou wilt; for thou art not silent as it is. Thou shalt never take the sons of Hear, then, my answer too to that, if so thou wilt. I will hear thee; not that I wish it, but I must give thee thy turn. I will bury the dead, when from Asopus’ land I have removed them. First must thou adventure somewhat in the front of war. Many an enterprise and of a different kind have I ere this endured. Wert thou then begotten of thy sire to cope with every foe? Ay, with all wanton villains; virtue I punish not. To meddle is aye thy wont and thy city’s too. Hence her enterprise on many a held hath won her frequent success. Come then, that the warriors of the dragon-crop may catch thee in our city. What furious warrior-host could spring from dragon’s seed? Thou shalt learn that to thy cost. As yet thou art young and rash. Thy boastful speech stirs not my heart at all to rage. Yet get thee gone from my land, taking with thee the idle words thou broughtest; for we are making no advance. ’Tis time for all to start, each stout footman, and whoso mounts the car; ’tis time the bit, dripping with foam, should urge the charger on toward the land of Cadmus. For I will march in person to the seven gates thereof with the sharp sword in my hand, and be myself my herald. But thee, Adrastus, I bid stay, nor blend with mine thy fortunes, for I will take my own good star to lead insures victory. For their valour availeth men naught, unless they have the god’s goodwill. Unhappy mothers of those hapless chiefs! How wildly in my heart pale fear stirs up alarm! What is this new cry thou utterest? I fear the issue of the strife, whereto the hosts of Pallas march. Dost speak of issues of the sword, or interchange of words? That last were gain indeed; but if the carnage of battle, fighting, and the noise of beaten breasts again be heard in the land, what, alas! will be said of me, who am the cause thereof? Yet may fate again bring low the brilliant victor; ’tis this brave thought that twines about my heart. Thou speak’st of the gods as if they were just. For who but they allot whate’er betides? I see many a contradiction in their dealings with men. The former fear hath warped thy judgment. Vengeance calls vengeance forth; slaughter calls for slaughter, but the gods give respite from affliction, holding in their own hands each thing’s allotted end. Would I could reach yon plains with turrets crowned, leaving Callichorus, fountain of the goddess! O that some god would give me wings to fly to the city of rivers twain! So might’st thou see and know the fortunes of thy friends. What fate, what issue there awaits the valiant monarch of this land? Once more do we invoke the gods we called upon before; yea, in our fear this is our first and chiefest trust. O Zeus, father to the child the heifer-mother bore in days long past, that daughter of Inachus! O be gracious, I pray, and champion this city! ’Tis thy own darling, thy own settler in the city of Ladies, I bring you tidings of great joy, myself escaped—for I was taken prisoner in the battle which cost those chieftains seven their lives near Dirce’s fount—to bear the news of Theseus’ victory. But I will save thee tedious questioning; I was the servant of Capaneus, whom Zeus with scorching bolt to ashes burnt. Friend of friends, fair thy news of thy own return, nor less the news about Theseus; and if the host of ’Tis safe, and all hath happened as I would it had befallen Adrastus and his Argives, whom from Inachus he led, to march against the city of the Cadmeans. How did the son of Aegeus and his fellow-warriors raise their trophy to Zeus? Tell us, for thou wert there and canst gladden us who were not. Bright shone the sun, one levelled line of light, upon the world, as by Electra’s gate I stood to watch, from a turret with a far outlook. And lo! I saw the host in three divisions, deploying its mail-clad warriors on the high ground by the banks of Ismenus; this last I heard; hard by the fountain of Ares, were the dwellers by the sea, harnessed spearmen they; on either wing were posted cavalry, in equal numbers, and chariots were stationed in the shelter of Amphion’s holy tomb. Meantime, the folk of Cadmus set themselves before the walls, placing in the rear the bodies for which they fought. Horse to horse, and car to car stood ranged. Then did the herald of Theseus cry aloud to all: Not a word would Creon let his herald answer back, but there he stood in silence under arms. Then did the drivers of the four-horse cars begin the fray; on, past each other they drave their chariots, bringing the warriors at their sides up into line. Some fought with swords, some wheeled the horses back to the fray again for those they drove. Now when Phorbas, who captained the cavalry of the Erechthidae, saw the thronging chariots, he and they who had the charge of the Theban horse met hand to hand, and by turns were victors and vanquished. The many horrors happening there I saw, not merely heard about, for I was at the spot where the chariots and their riders met and fought, but which to tell of first I know not,—the clouds of dust that mounted to the sky, the warriors tangled in the reins and dragged the streams of crimson gore, when men fell dead, or when, from shattered chariot-seats, they tumble headlong to the ground, and, mid the splinters of their cars, gave up the ghost. But Creon, when he marked our cavalry’s success caught up a shield and rushed into the were dealing death and courting it, shouting loudly each to his fellow the battle-cry: our left wing, albeit theirs was routed by our right and put to flight, so that the struggle was evenly balanced. Here again our chief deserved all praise, for this success was not the only advantage he gained; no! next he sought that part of his army which was wavering; and loud he called to them, that the earth rang again, and swung it to and fro, and with that club, as with a sickle, he shore off necks and heads and helmets thereupon. Scarce even then they turned them- selves to fly. For joy cried I, and danced and clapped my hands; while to the gates they ran. Throughout the town echoed the shrieks of young and old, as they crowded the temples in terror. But Theseus, when he might have come inside the walls, held back his men, for he had not come, said he, to sack the town, but to ask for the bodies of the dead. Such the general men should choose, one who shows his bravery in danger, yet hates the pride of those that in their hour of fortune lose the bliss they might have enjoyed, through seeking to scale the ladder’s topmost step. Now do I believe in the gods after seeing this O Zeus, why do men assert the wisdom of the wretched human race? On thee we all depend, and all we do is only what thou listest. We thought our in spite of his fair offer we would not accept them, and so we perished. Then in their turn those foolish folk of Cadmus, to fortune raised, like some beggar with his newly-gotten wealth, waxed wanton, and, waxing so, were ruined in their turn. Ye foolish sons of men! who strain your bow like men who shoot beyond their mark, and only by suffering many evils as ye deserve, though deaf to friends, yet yield to circumstances; ye cities likewise, though ye might by parley end your mischief, yet ye choose the sword instead of reason to settle all disputes. But wherefore these reflections? This I fain would learn, the way thou didst escape; and after that I will ask thee of the rest. During the uproar which prevailed in the city owing to the battle, I passed the gates, just as the host had entered them. Are ye bringing the bodies, for the which the strife arose? Ay, each of the seven chiefs who led their famous hosts. What sayest thou? the rest who fell—say, where are they? They have found burial in the dells of Cithseron. On this or that side of the mount? And who did bury them? Theseus buried them ’neath the shadow of Eleutherae’s cliff. Where didst thou leave the dead he hath not buried? Not far away; earnest haste makes every goal look close. No doubt in sorrow slaves would gather them from the carnage. Slaves! not one of them was set to do this toil. Thou wouldst say so, hadst thou been there to see his loving tendance of the dead. Did he himself wash the bloody wounds of the hapless youths? Ay, and strewed their biers and wrapped them in their shrouds. An awful burden Why, what disgrace to men are their fellows’ sorrows? Ah me! how much rather had I died with them! ’Tis vain to weep and move to tears these women. Methinks ’tis they who give the lesson. Enough whose loss I mourn in wretched solitude; for this one thing, when once ’tis spent, man cannot recover, the breath of life, though he knoweth ways to get his wealth again. Joy is here and sorrow too,— for the state fair fame, and for our captains double meed of honour. Bitter for me it is to see the limbs of my dead sons, and yet a welcome sight withal, because I shall behold the unexpected day after sorrow’s cup was full. Would that Father Time had kept me unwed from my youth up e’en till now when I Methinks I should not have suffered excessively, had I never borne the marriage-yoke; but now I have my sorrow full in view, the loss of children dear. Lo! I see the bodies of the fallen youths. Woe is me! would I could join these children in their death and descend to Hades with them! Mothers, raise the wail for the dead departed; cry in answer when ye hear my note of woe. My sons, my sons! O bitter words for loving mothers to address to you! To thee, my lifeless child, I call. Woe! woe! Ah me, my sufferings! Alas! We have endured, alas!— Sorrows most grievous. O citizens of They see thee, and me the hapless mother, reft of her children. Bring near the blood-boltered corpses of those hapless chiefs, foully slain by foes unworthy, with whom lay the decision of the contest. Let me embrace and hold my children to my bosom in my enfolding arms. There, there! thou hast— Sorrows heavy enough to bear. Ah me! Thy groans mingle with those of their parents. Hear me. O’er both of us thou dost lament. Would God the Theban ranks had laid me dead in the dust! Oh that I had ne’er been wedded to a husband! Behold this sea of troubles! Ah! hapless mothers. Our nails have ploughed our cheeks in furrows, and o’er our heads have we strewn ashes. Ah me! ah me! Oh that earth’s floor would swallow me, or the whirlwind snatch me away, or Zeus’s flaming bolt descend upon my head! Bitter the marriages thou didst witness, bitter the oracle of Phoebus! The curse of Oedipus, fraught with sorrow, after desolating and left it alone, I now do ask Adrastus, Of what lineage sprang those youths, to shine so bright in chivalry? Tell it to our younger citizens of thy fuller wisdom, for thou art skilled to know. Myself beheld their daring deeds, too high for words to tell, whereby they thought to capture or him who speaks, that any man amid the fray, when clouds of darts are hurtling before his eyes, should declare for certain who each champion is. I could not ask such questions, nor yet believe those who dare assert the like; for when a man is face to face with the foe, he scarce can see even that which ’tis his bounden duty to observe. Hearken then. For in giving this task to me thou Dost see yon corpse by Zeus’s bolt transfixed? That is Capaneus; though he had ample wealth, yet was he the last to boast of his prosperity; nor would he ever vaunt himself above a poorer neighbour, but shunned the man whose sumptuous board had puffed him up too high and made him scorn mere competence, for he held that virtue lies not in greedy gluttony, but that moderate means suffice. True friend was he, alike to present or to absent friends the same; of such the number is not great. His was a guileless character, a courteous address, that left no promise unperformed either towards his own household or his fellow-citizens. The next I name is Eteocles; a master he of other kinds of excellence; young, nor richly dowered with store, yet high in honour in the Argive land. And though his friends oft offered gifts of gold, he would not have it in his house, to make his character its slave by taking wealth’s yoke upon him. Not his city, but those that sinned against her did he hate, for a city is no wise to be blamed if it get an evil name by reason of an evil governor. Such another was Hippomedon, third of all this band; from his very boyhood he refrained from turning towards the allurements of the Muses, to lead a life of ease; his home was in the fields, and gladly would he school his nature to hardships with a view to manliness, aye hasting to the chase, rejoicing in his steeds or straining of his bow, because he would make himself of use unto his state. Next behold the huntress Atalanta’s son, Parthenopaeus, a youth of peerless beauty; from Arcady he came even to the streams of Inachus, and in citizen or stranger can give, but took his stand amid the host, and fought for yet was he careful to avoid offence. Of Tydeus next the lofty praise I will express in brief; no brilliant spokesman he, but a clever craftsman in the art of war, with many a shrewd yet through his warrior skill lending his name to equal praise, for he had found in arms a perfect science; his was an ambitious nature, a spirit rich in store of deeds, with words less fully dowered. From this account then wonder not, Theseus, that they dared to die before the towers; for noble nurture carries honour with it, and every man, when once he hath practised virtue, scorns the name of villain. Courage may be learnt, for even a babe doth learn to speak and hear things it cannot comprehend; and whatso’er a child Alas! my son, to sorrow I bare thee and carried thee within my womb, enduring the pangs of travail; but now Hades takes the fruit of all my hapless toil, and I that; had a son am left, ah me! with none to nurse my age. As for the noble son of Oecleus, him, while yet he lived, the gods snatched hence to the bowels of the earth, and. his chariot too, manifestly blessing him; while I myself may truthfully tell the praises of the son of Oedipus, that is, Polynices, for he was my guest-friend ere he left the town of Cadmus and crossed to I know naught save this,—to yield obedience to thy hests. As for yon Capaneus, stricken by the bolt of Zeus— Wilt bury him apart as a consecrated corpse? Even so; but all the rest on one funeral pyre. Where wilt thou set the tomb apart for him? Here near this temple have I builded him a sepulchre. Thy thralls forthwith must undertake this toil. Myself will look to those others; let the biers advance. Approach your sons, unhappy mothers. This thy proposal, Adrastus, is anything but good. Must not the mothers touch their sons? It would kill them to see how they are altered. ’Tis bitter, truly, to see the dead even Why then wilt thou add fresh grief to them? Thou art right. Ye Why do ye get you weapons and bring slaughter on one another? Cease therefrom, give o’er your toiling, and in mutual peace keep safe your cities. Short is the span of life, so ’twere best to run its course as lightly as we may, from trouble free. No more a happy mother I, with children blest; no more I share, among Argive women, who have sons, their happy lot; nor any more will Artemis in the hour of travail kindly greet these childless mothers. Most dreary is my life, and like some wandering cloud I drift before the howling blast. The seven noblest sons in we seven hapless mothers; but now my sons are dead, I have no child, and on me steals old age in piteous wise, having as it were a lot apart from these. Tears alone are left me; in my house sad memories of my son are stored; mournful tresses shorn from his head, chaplets that he wore, libations for the dead departed, and songs, but not such as golden-haired Apollo welcometh; and when I wake to weep, my tears will ever drench the folds of my robe upon my bosom. Ah! there I see the sepulchre ready e’en now for Capaneus, his consecrated tomb, and the votive offerings Theseus gives unto the dead outside the shrine, and nigh yon lightning-smitten chief I see his noble bride, Evadne, daughter of King Iphis. Wherefore stands she on the towering rock, which o’ertops this temple, advancing along yon path? What light, what radiancy did the sun-god’s car dart forth, and the moon athwart the firmament, while round her in the gloom swift stars in the day that the city of Now from my home in frantic haste with frenzied mind I rush to join thee, seeking to share with thee the fire’s bright flame and the self-same tomb, to rid me of my weary life in Hades’ halls, and of the pains of existence; yea, for ’tis the sweetest end to share the death of those we love, if only fate will sanction it. Behold yon pyre, which thou art overlooking, nigh thereto, set apart for Zeus! There is thy husband’s body, vanquished by the blazing bolt. Life’s goal I now behold from my station here; may fortune aid me in my headlong leap from this rock in honour’s cause, down into the fire below, to mix my ashes with my husband’s, to lay me side by side with him, there in the couch of Persephone; for ne’er will I, to save my life, prove untrue to thee where thou liest in thy grave. Away with life and marriage too! Oh! his nature fusing with his wife’s! Lo! the aged Iphis, thy father, draweth nigh to hear thy startling scheme, which yet he knows not and will grieve to learn. Unhappy child! lo! I am come, a poor old man, with twofold sorrow in my house to mourn, that I may carry to his native land the corpse of my son Eteocles, slain by the Theban spear, and further in quest of my daughter who rushed headlong from the house, for she was the wife of Capaneus and longed with him to die. Ere this she was well guarded in my house, but, when I took the watch away in the present troubles, she escaped. But I feel sure that she is here; tell me if ye have seen her. Why question them? Lo, here upon the rock, father, o’er the pyre of Capaneus, like some bird I hover lightly, in my wretchedness. What wind hath blown thee hither, child? Whither away? Why didst thou pass the threshold of my house and seek this land? It would but anger thee to hear what I intend, and so I fain would keep thee ignorant, my father. What! hath not thy own father a right to know? Thou wouldst not wisely judge my intention. Why dost thou deck thyself in that apparel? A purport strange this robe conveys, father. Thou hast no look of mourning for thy lord. No, the reason why I thus am decked is strange, maybe. Dost thou in such garb appear before a funeral-pyre? Yea, for hither it is I come to take the meed of victory. A victory o’er all women on whom the sun looks down. In Athena’s handiwork or in prudent counsel? In bravery; for I will lay me down and die with my lord. What dost thou say? What is this silly riddle thou propoundest? To yonder pyre where lies dead Capaneus, I will leap down. My daughter, speak not thus before the multitude! The very thing I wish, that every Argive should learn it. Nay, I will ne’er consent to let thee do this deed.  Lo! I cast me down, no joy to thee, but to myself and to my husband blazing on the pyre with me. O lady, what a fearful deed! Ah me! I am undone, ye dames of Alack, alack! a cruel blow is this to thee, but thou must yet witness, poor wretch, the full horror of this deed. A more unhappy wretch than me ye could not find. Woe for thee, unhappy man! Thou, old sir, hast been made partaker in the fortune of Oedipus, thou and my poor city too. Ah, why are mortal men denied this boon, to live their youth twice o’er, and twice in turn to reach old age? If aught goes wrong within our homes, we set it right by judgment more maturely formed, but our life we may not so correct. Now if we had a second spell of youth and age, this double term of life would let us then correct each previous slip. I, for instance, seeing others blest with children, longed to have them too, and found my ruin in that wish. Whereas if I had had my present experience, and by a father’s light Shall I to my home, there to see its utter desolation and the blank within my life? or shall I to the halls of that dead Capaneus?—halls I smiled to see in days gone by, when yet my daughter was alive. But she is lost and gone, she that would ever draw down my cheek to her lips, and take my head between her hands; for naught is there more sweet unto an aged sire than a daughter’s love; our sons are made of sterner stuff, but less winning are their caresses. Oh! take me to my house at once, in darkness hide me there, to waste and fret this aged frame with fasting! What shall it avail me to touch my daughter’s bones? Old age, resistless foe, how do I loathe thy presence! Them too I hate, whoso desire to lengthen out the span of life, seeking to turn the tide of death aside by philtres, Woe, woe! Behold your dead sons’ bones are brought hither; take them, servants of your weak old mistress, for in me is no strength left by reason of my mourning for my sons; time’s comrade long have I been, and many a tear for many a sorrow have I shed. For what sharper pang wilt thou ever find for mortals than the sight of children dead? Poor mother mine, behold I bring my father’s bones gathered from the fire, a burden grief has rendered heavy, though this tiny urn contains my all. Ah me! ah me! Why bear thy tearful load to the fond mother of the dead, a handful of ashes in the stead of those who erst were men of mark in Mycenae? Woe worth the hour! woe worth the day! Reft of my hapless sire, a wretched orphan shall I inherit a desolate house, torn from my father’s arms. Woe is thee! Where is now the toil I spent upon my sons? what thank have I for nightly watch? Where the mother’s nursing care? the sleepless vigils mine eyes have kept? the loving kiss upon my children’s brow? Thy sons are dead and gone. Poor mother! dead and gone; the boundless air now wraps them round. Turned to ashes by the flame, they have winged their flight to Hades. Father, thou hearest thy children’s lamentation; say, shall I e’er, as warrior dight, avenge thy slaughter? God grant it, O my child! Some day, if god so will, shall the avenging of my father be my task; not yet this sorrow sleeps. Alas! Fortune’s sorrows are enough for me, I have troubles and to spare already. Shall Asopus’ laughing tide ever reflect my brazen arms as I lead on my Argive troops? To avenge thy fallen sire. Methinks I see thee still before my eyes, my father— Printing a loving kiss upon thy cheek. But thy words of exhortation are borne on the winds away. Two mourners hath he left behind, thy mother and thee, bequeathing to thee an endless legacy of grief for thy father. The weight of grief I have to bear hath crushed me utterly. Come, let me clasp the ashes of my son to my bosom. I weep to hear that piteous word; it stabs me to the heart. My child, thou art undone; no more shall I behold thee, thy own fond mother’s treasure. Adrastus, and ye dames from marking well the treatment ye have had of me. And to these children I repeat the self-same words, that they may honour this city, to children’s children ever handing on the kindness ye received from us. Be Zeus the witness, with the gods in heaven, of the treatment we vouchsafed you ere you left us. Theseus, well we know all the kindness thou hast conferred upon the land of What yet remains, wherein I can serve you? Fare thee well, for such is thy desert and such thy city’s too. Fare thee well, for such is thy desert and such thy city’s too. Hearken, Theseus, to the words that I Athena utter, telling thee thy duty, which, if thou perform it, will serve thy city. Give not these bones to the children to carry to the land of to take the oath for the whole realm of that the land of Now hearken while I tell thee where thou must slay the victims. Thou hast within thy halls a tripod with brazen feet, which Heracles, in days gone by, after he had o’erthrown the foundations of Ilium and was starting on another enterprise, enjoined thee to set up at the Pythian shrine. O’er it cut the throats of three sheep; then grave within the tripod’s hollow belly the oath; this done, deliver it to the god who watches over And bury the sharp-edged knife, wherewith thou shalt have laid the victims open and shed their blood, deep in the bowels of the earth, hard by the pyres where the seven chieftains burn; for its appearance shall strike them with dismay, if e’er against thy town they come, and shall cause them to return with sorrow. When thou hast done all this, dismiss the dead from thy land. And to the god resign as sacred land the spot where their bodies were purified by fire, there by the meeting of the triple roads that lead unto the Isthmus. Thus much to thee, Theseus, I address; next to the sons of avenging the slaughter of your dead sires; thou too, Aegialeus, shalt take thy father’s place and in thy youth command the host, and with thee must ye lead an armed Danaid host against the battlements of and ye shall be a theme for minstrels’ songs in days to come, known through Queen Athena, I will hearken to thy bidding; for thou it is dost set me up, so that I go not astray. And I will bind this monarch by an oath; do thou but guide my steps aright. For if thou art friendly to our state, we shall henceforth live secure. Let us go, Adrastus, and take the oath to this monarch and his state; for the service they have already done us claims our warm regard.  \n",

                    From the depths of salt set towers of stone about this land of Phocian Epeus, aided by the craft of Pallas, framed a horse to bear within its womb an armed army, and sent it within the battlements, a deadly statue; Groves stand forsaken and temples of the gods run down with blood, and at the altar’s very base, before the god who watched his home, Priam lies dead. While to Achaean ships great store of gold and Phrygian spoils are being conveyed, and they who came against this town, those sons of I am leaving daughter of Tyndareus, justly counted among the captives. And if you would see that queen of misery, Hecuba, you can; for there she lies before the gates, weeping many tears for many sorrows; at Achilles’ tomb, without her knowledge, her daughter Polyxena has died most piteously; Priam is gone, and her children too; Cassandra, whom the lord Apollo left to be a virgin, frenzied maid, has been forced by Agamemnon, in contempt of the god’s ordinance and of piety, to a dishonored wedlock. Farewell, O city once prosperous! farewell, you ramparts of polished stone! if Pallas, daughter of Zeus, had not decreed your ruin, you would be standing firmly still. May I address the mighty god whom the gods revere and who to my own father is very near in blood, laying aside our former enmity? You may; for over the soul the ties of kin exert no feeble spell, great queen Athena. For your forgiving mood my thanks! I have messages to impart affecting both yourself and me, lord. Do you bring fresh tidings from some god, from Zeus, or from some lesser power? From none of these; but on behalf of What! have you laid your former hate aside to take compassion on the town now that it is burnt to ashes? First go back to the former point; will you make common cause with me in the scheme I purpose? Yes, surely; but I want to learn your wishes, whether you have come to help Achaeans or Phrygians. I wish to give my former foes, the Trojans, joy, and on the Achaean army impose a bitter return. Why do you leap thus from mood to mood? Your love and hate both go too far, on whomever centred. Do you not know the insult done to me and to the shrine I love? I do: when Aias dragged away Cassandra by force. Yes, and the Achaeans did nothing, said nothing to him. And yet it was by your mighty aid they sacked For which cause I would join with you to do them harm. My powers are ready at your will. What is your intent? I will impose on them a return that is no return. While they stay on shore, or as they cross the salt sea? When they have set sail from and inky tempests from the sky; and he promises to grant me his thunder-bolts to hurl on the Achaeans and fire their ships. And you, for your part, make the that Achaeans may learn henceforth to reverence my temples and regard all other deities. So shall it be, for this favor needs only a few words. I will vex the broad Scyros and A fool is he who sacks the towns of men, with shrines and tombs, the dead man’s hallowed home, for at the last he makes a desert round himself and dies. Lift your head, unhappy one, from the ground; raise up your neck; this is no longer am I queen in Ah me! ah me! What else but tears is now my hapless lot, whose country, children, husband, all are lost? Ah! the high-blown pride of ancestors, humbled! how brought to nothing after all! What woe must I suppress, or what declare? O my head, my temples, my side! How I long to turn over, and lie now on this, now on that, to rest my back and spine, while ceaselessly my tearful wail ascends. For even this is music to the wretched, to chant their cheerless dirge of sorrow. You swift-prowed ships, rowed to sacred past the fair havens of to the bays of Priam, the father of fifty children; the cause why I, the unhappy Hecuba, have wrecked my life upon this disastrous strand. Oh that I should sit here, over against the tent of Agamemnon! As a slave I am led away from my home, an old woman, while from my head the hair is piteously shorn for grief. Ah! unhappy wives of those armored sons of come weep, for I once sang to the gods, as I leaned on Priam’s staff and beat with my foot in Phrygian time to lead the dance! O Hecuba! why these cries, these piercing shrieks? What do your words mean? For I heard your piteous wail echo through the building, and a pang of terror shoots through each captive Trojan’s breast, as within these walls they mourn their slavish lot. My child, even now at the ships of the Argives— Ah, woe is me! what is their intent? Will they really carry me away from my country in their fleet? I do not know, though I guess our doom. O misery! woe to us Trojan women, soon to hear of our troubles: Oh! please do not bid the wild Cassandra leave her chamber, the frantic prophetess, for Argives to insult, nor to my griefs add yet another. Woe to you, ill-fated who are leaving you behind! With trembling step, alas! I leave this tent of Agamemnon to learn of you, my royal mistress, whether the Argives have resolved to take my wretched life, or whether the sailors at the prow are making ready to ply their oars. My child, your wakeful heart! I have come, stricken with terror. Has a herald from the Danaids already arrived? To whom am I, poor captive, given as a slave? You are not far from being allotted now. Alas! What man of Ah! ah! Whose slave shall I become in my old age? in what land? a poor old drone, the wretched copy of a corpse, alas! set to keep the gate or tend their children, I who once held royal rank in Alas, alas! What piteous dirge will you devise to mourn the outrage done you? No more through Ida’s looms shall I ply the shuttle to and fro. I look my last on my children’s bodies, my last; I shall endure surpassing misery, it may be as the unwilling bride of some Hellene (perish the night and fortune that brings me to this!); it may be as a wretched slave from Peirene’s sacred fount I shall draw their store of water. Oh! may it be ours to come to Theseus’ famous realm, a land of joy. Never, never let me see Eurotas’ swirling tide, hateful home of Helen, there to meet and be the slave of Menelaus, whose hand laid That holy land by Peneus fed, nestling in all its beauty at They tell me too Hephaestus’ home, beneath the shadow of But see! a herald from the army of Danaids, with a store of fresh proclamations, comes hastening here. What is his errand? What does he say? For we are indeed slaves now to Dorian lords. Hecuba, you know me from my many journeys to and fro as herald between the Achaean army and Ah, kind friends, it has come! what I so long have dreaded. The lot has decided your fates already, if that was what you feared. Ah me! What city did you say, Thessalian, Phthian, or Cadmean? Each warrior took his prize in turn; you were not all at once assigned. To whom has the lot assigned us severally? Which of us Trojan women does a happy fortune await? I know, but ask your questions separately, not all at once. Then tell me, whose prize is my daughter, hapless Cassandra? King Agamemnon has chosen her out for himself. To be the slave-girl of his Spartan wife? Ah me! No, to share with him his stealthy love. What! Phoebus’ virgin-priestess, to whom the god with golden locks granted the gift of maidenhood? The dart of love has pierced his heart, love for the frenzied maid. Daughter, cast from you the sacred keys, and from your body tear the holy wreaths that drape you in their folds. Why! is it not an honor that she should win our monarch’s love? What have you done to her whom recently you took from me, my child? Do you mean Polyxena, or whom do you inquire about? Yes, that one; to whom has the lot assigned her? To minister at Achilles’ tomb has been appointed her. Woe is me! I the mother of a dead man’s slave! What custom, what ordinance is this among Hellenes, friend? Count your daughter happy; it is well with her. What wild words are these? Please tell me, is she still alive? Her fate is one that sets her free from trouble. And what of the wife of She too was a chosen prize; Achilles’ son took her. As for me whose hair is white with age, who need to hold a staff to be to me a third foot, whose servant am I to be? Odysseus, king of Oh, oh! Now smite the close-shorn head! tear your cheeks with your nails! Ah me! I have fallen as a slave to a treacherous foe I hate, a monster of lawlessness, one that by his double tongue has turned against us all that once was friendly in his camp, changing this for that and that for this again. Oh weep for me, you Trojan women! Lost and ill-fated! Ah woe! a victim to a most unhappy lot! Your fate, royal mistress, now you know; but for me, what Go,  servants, and bring at once, that I may place her in our captain’s hands, and then conduct to the rest of the chiefs the captives each has had assigned. Ha! what is the blaze of torches there within? What are they doing? Are they firing the chambers, because they must leave this land and be carried away to but finds small favor with the Achaeans, bring blame on me. It is not that they are setting anything ablaze, but my child Bring the light, uplift and show its flame! I am doing the god’s service, see! see! making his shrine to glow with tapers bright. O Hymen, lord of marriage! blessed is the bridegroom; blessed am I also, soon to wed a princely lord in Since you, my mother, are busied with tears and lamentations in your mourning for my father’s death and for our country dear, I at my own nuptials am making this torch to blaze and show its light, giving to you, O Hymen, giving, O Hecate, a light, at the maiden’s wedding, as the custom is. Nimbly lift the foot; lead the dance on high, with cries of joy, as if to greet my father’s happy fate. The dance is sacred. Come, Phoebus, now, for it is in your temple among your bay-trees that I minister. Hail Hymen, god of marriage! Hymen, hail! Dance, mother, and laugh! link your steps with me, and circle in the delightful measure, now here, now there. Salute the bride on her wedding-day with hymns and cries of joy. Come, you maids of with the husband fate ordains that I should wed. Hold the frantic maiden, royal mistress, lest with nimble foot she rush to the You god of fire, it is yours to light the bridal torch for men, but piteous is the flame you kindle here, beyond my blackest expectation. Ah, my child! how little did I ever dream that such would be your marriage, a captive, and of but still you are as frantic as before. Take in those torches, Trojan friends, and for her wedding madrigals weep your tears instead. O mother, crown my head with victor’s wreaths; rejoice in my royal match; lead me and if you find me unwilling at all, thrust me there by force; for if Loxias is indeed a prophet, Agamemnon, that famous king of the Achaeans, will find in me a bride more vexatious than Helen. For I will slay him and lay waste his home to avenge my father’s and my brothers’ death. But let that go; I will not tell of that axe which shall sever my neck and the necks of others, or of the conflict ending in a mother’s death, which my marriage shall cause, nor of the overthrow of Atreus’ house. But I, for all my frenzy, will so far rise above my frantic fit, that I will prove this city happier far than those Achaeans, who for the sake of one woman and one passion have lost a countless army in hunting Helen. Their captain too, whom men call wise, has lost for what he hated most what most he prized, yielding to his brother for a woman’s sake—and she was willing and not taken by force—the joy he had of his own children in his home. For from the day that they landed upon Scamander’s strand, their doom began, not for loss of stolen frontier nor yet for fatherland with high towers; whomever Ares took, those never saw their children again, nor were they shrouded for the tomb by hand of wife, but in a foreign land they lie. At home the case was still the same; wives were dying widows, parents were left childless in their homes, having reared their sons for others, and none is left to make libations of blood upon the ground before their tombs. Truly to such praise as this their army can make an ample claim. It is better to pass by their shame in silence, nor may mine be the Muse to tell that evil tale. But the Trojans were dying, first for their fatherland, fairest fame to win; whomever the sword took, all these found friends to bear their bodies home and were laid to rest in the embrace of their native land, their funeral rites all duly paid by duteous hands. And all such Phrygians as escaped the warrior’s death lived always day by day with wife and children by them, joys the Achaeans had left behind. As for Hector and his griefs, hear how the case stands; he is dead and gone, but still his fame remains as bravest of the brave, and this was a result of the Achaeans’ coming; for had they remained at home, his worth would have gone unnoticed. And Whoever is wise should fly from making war; but if he come to this, a noble death will crown his city with glory, a coward’s end with shame. Therefore, mother, you should not pity your country or my bed, for this my marriage will destroy those whom you and I most hate. How sweetly at your own sad lot you smile, chanting a strain, which, in spite of you, may prove you wrong! Had not Apollo turned your wits to maenad revelry, you would not for nothing have sent my chiefs with such ominous predictions forth on their way. But, after all, these lofty minds, reputed wise, are nothing better than those that are held as nothing. For that mighty king of all for this mad maiden of all others; though I am poor enough, yet would I never have chosen such a wife as this. As for you, since your senses are not whole, I give your taunts against to the ships to grace the wedding of our chief. And you too follow, whenever the son of A clever fellow, this servant! Why is it heralds hold the name they do? All men unite in hating with one common hate the attendants of kings or governments. You say my mother shall come to the halls of Odysseus? Where then are Apollo’s words, so clear to me in their interpretation, which declare that she shall die here? What else remains, I will not taunt her with. Unhappy Odysseus, he does not know the sufferings that await him; or how these ills I and my Phrygians endure shall one day seem to him precious as gold. For beyond the ten long years spent at where dreadful Charybdis lurks in a narrow channel between the rocks; past whose flesh shall utter in the days to come a human voice, bitter to Odysseus. In brief, he shall descend alive to Hades, and, though he shall escape the waters’ flood, yet shall he find a thousand troubles in his country when he arrives. Enough! why do I recount the troubles of Odysseus? Lead on at once, that I may wed my husband for his home in Hades’ halls. Base you are, and basely shall you be buried, in the dead of night when day is done, you captain of that army of Danaids, who think so proudly of your fortune! Yes, and the rocky chasm with its flood of wintry waters shall give my corpse cast forth in nakedness to wild beasts to make their meal upon, near my husband’s tomb, I, Apollo’s servant. O garlands of that god most dear to me! farewell, you mystic symbols! I here resign your feasts, my joy in days gone by. Go, I tear you from my body, that, while yet mine honor is intact, I may give them to the rushing winds to waft to you, my prince of prophecy! Where is that general’s ship? Where must I go to take my place there? Lose no further time in watching for a favoring breeze to fill your sails, doomed as you are to carry from this land one of the three avenging spirits. Fare you well, mother! dry your tears. O dear country!  my brothers below the earth and my own father, it will not be long before you shall welcome me; victory shall crown my advent among the dead, when I have overthrown the home of our destroyers, the house of the sons of Atreus. You guardians of the grey-haired Hecuba, see how your mistress is sinking speechless to the ground! Take hold of her! will you let her fall, you worthless slaves? lift up again, from where it lies, her withered body. Leave me, my maidens—unwelcome service does not grow welcome—lying where I fell; my sufferings now, my troubles past, afflictions yet to come, all claim this lowly posture. Gods of heaven! small help I find in calling such allies, yet is there something in the form of invoking heaven, whenever we fall on evil days. First I will sing of my former blessings; so shall I inspire the greater pity for my present woes. Born to royal estate and wedded to a royal lord, I was the mother of a race of gallant sons; no mere ciphers they, but and at their tombs have I shorn off my hair; with these my eyes I saw their father, Priam, butchered on his own hearth, and my city captured, nor did others bring this bitter news to me. The maidens I brought up to see chosen for some marriage high, for strangers have I reared them, and seen them snatched away. Nevermore can I hope to be seen by them, nor shall my eyes behold them ever in the days to come. And last, to crown my misery, I shall be brought to lay down my shrunken limbs, with tattered rags about my wasted frame, a shameful garb for those who once were prosperous. Ah, woe is me! and this is what I bear and am to bear for one woman’s marriage! O my daughter, O Cassandra! whom gods have summoned to their frenzied train, how cruel the lot that ends your virgin days! And you, Polyxena! my child of sorrow, where, oh! where are you? None of all the many sons and daughters I have born comes to aid a wretched mother. Why then raise me up? What hope is left us? Guide me, who before trod so daintily the streets of Of all the prosperous crowd, count none a happy man before he die. Sing me, Muse, a tale of for now I will uplift for loud rumbling to the sky, with its trappings of gold and its freight of warriors; and our people cried out as they stood upon the rocky citadel, they took the fatal snare within. Then hastened all the race of Dardania’s ruin, a welcome gift to be to her, the virgin queen of deathless steeds; and with nooses of cord they dragged it, as it had been a ship’s dark hull, to the stone-built temple of the goddess Pallas, and set it on that floor so soon to drink our country’s blood. But, as they labored and made merry, came on the pitchy night; loud the Libyan flute was sounding, and Phrygian songs awoke, while maidens beat the ground with airy foot, uplifting their glad song; and in the halls a blaze of torchlight shed its flickering shadows on sleeping eyes. In that hour around the house I was singing as I danced to that maiden of the hills, the child of Zeus; when there rang along the town a cry of death which filled the homes of as forth from their ambush came the warrior-band, the handiwork of maiden Pallas. Soon the altars ran with Phrygian blood, and desolation reigned over every bed where young men lay beheaded, a glorious crown for Hecuba, do you see Andromache advancing here on a foreign chariot? and with her, clasped to her throbbing breast, is her dear Astyanax, Hector’s child. Where are you being carried, unhappy wife, mounted on that chariot, side by side with Hector’s brazen arms and Phrygian spoils of war, with which Achilles’ son will deck the shrines of Phthia on his return from My Achaean masters are leading me away. Ah me! Why do you in note of woe utter the dirge that is mine? Alas— For these sorrows— O Zeus— And for this calamity. O my children! Our day is past. Joy is gone, Unhappy! For my gallant sons Alas! Alas indeed, for my Misery! Piteous the fate Of our city, Smouldering in the smoke. Come to me, my husband, come to me! Ah, hapless wife! you call on my son who lies in the tomb. Your wife’s defender! Oh, you, who before made the Achaeans grieve, eldest of the sons I bore to Priam, take me to your rest in Hades’ halls! These great griefs— Unhappy one, bitter these woes to bear. Our city ruined— And sorrow to sorrow added. Through the will of angry heaven, since the day that son and O my country, O unhappy land— I weep for you now left behind. Now do you behold your piteous end. And you, my house, where I gave birth. O my children! bereft of her city as your mother is, she now is losing you. Oh, what mourning and what sorrow! . . . oh, what endless streams of tears in our houses! The dead alone forget their griefs What sweet relief to sufferers it is to weep, to mourn, lament, and chant the dirge that tells of grief! Do you see this, mother of that man, Hector, who once laid low in battle many a son of I see that it is heaven’s way to exalt what men accounted nothing, and ruin what they most esteemed. Hence with my child as booty am I borne; the noble are brought to slavery—a bitter change. This is necessity’s grim law; it was just now that Cassandra was torn with brutal violence from my arms. Alas, alas! it seems a second Aias has appeared to wrong your daughter; but there are other ills for you. Yes, beyond all count or measure are my sorrows; evil vies with evil in the struggle to be first. Your daughter Polyxena is dead, slain at O woe is me! This is that riddle Talthybius long ago told me, a truth obscurely uttered. I saw her myself; so I alighted from the chariot, and covered her corpse with a mantle, and struck upon my breast. Alas! my child, for your unhallowed sacrifice! and yet again, alas! for your shameful death! Her death was even as it was, and yet that death of hers was after all a happier fate than my life. Death and life are not the same, my child; the one is annihilation, the other keeps a place for hope. Hear, O mother of children! give ear to what I urge so well, that I may cheer my drooping spirit. It is all one, I say, never to have been born and to be dead, and better far is death than life with misery. For the dead feel no sorrow any more and know no grief; but he who has known prosperity and has fallen on evil days feels his spirit straying from the scene of former joys. Now that child of yours is dead as though she never had seen the light, and little she knows of her calamity; whereas I, who aimed at a fair repute, though I won a higher lot than most, yet missed my luck in life. For all that stamps the wife a woman chaste, I strove to do in therefore I gave up any longing to do so, and stayed within my house; nor would I admit indoors the clever gossip women love, but conscious of a heart that told an honest tale I was content. And ever would I keep a silent tongue and modest eye before my husband; and well I knew where I might rule him, and where it was best to yield. Report of this has reached the Achaean army, and proved my ruin; for when I was taken captive, Achilles’ son would have me as his wife, and I must serve in the house of murderers. And if I set aside my love for And yet they say a single night removes a woman’s dislike for her husband; I despise the woman who, when she has lost her former husband, transfers her love by marrying another. Not even the horse, if parted from her stablemate, will cheerfully draw the yoke; and animals have neither speech nor sense to help them, and are by nature man’s inferiors. O my dear while you took from my father’s house a spotless bride, yourself the first to make this maiden wife. But now death has claimed you, and I am soon to sail to for whom you wail, less evil to bear than I? I have not so much as hope, the last resource of every human heart, nor do I beguile myself with dreams of future bliss, the very thought of which is sweet. You are in the same plight as I; your lamentations for yourself remind me of my own sad case. I never yet have set foot on a ship’s deck, though I have seen such things in pictures and know of them from hearsay. Now sailors, if there comes a storm of moderate force, are all eagerness to save themselves by toil; one stands at the tiller, another sets himself to work the sheets, a third meanwhile is baling out the ship; but if tempestuous waves arise to overwhelm them, they yield to fortune and commit themselves to the driving billows. Even so I, by reason of my countless troubles, am speechless and forbear to say a word; for this surge of misery from the gods is too strong for me. Cease, my darling child, to speak of offering your sweet nature as the bait to win him. If you do this, you will cheer your friends as well as yourself and you shalt rear my Hector’s child to lend stout aid to may build her up again, and our city yet be established. But our talk must take a different turn; who is this Achaean servant I see coming here again, sent to tell us of some new design? You that once were the wife of Hector, bravest of the Phrygians, do not hate me, for I am not a willing messenger. The Danaids and sons of Pelops both command— What is it? your prelude bodes evil news. It is decreed your son is—how can I tell my news? Surely not to have a different master from me? None of all Is it their will to leave him here, a remnant of I know no words to break the sorrow lightly to you. I thank you for your consideration, unless indeed you have good news to tell. They mean to slay your son; there is my hateful message to you. Oh me! this is worse tidings than my forced marriage. So spoke Odysseus to the assembled Hellenes, and his word prevails. Oh, once again alas! there is no measure in the woes I bear. He said they should not rear so brave a father’s son. May such counsels prevail about children of his! He must be thrown from your husband and your city are no more, so you are in our power, and I alone am match enough for one woman; therefore I would not see you bent on strife, or any course to bring you shame or hate, nor would I hear you rashly curse the Achaeans. For if you say anything to anger the army, this child will find no burial nor pity either. But if you hold your peace and with composure take your fate, you will not leave his corpse unburied, and you yourself will find more favor with the Achaeans. My dearest! my own sweet child and priceless treasure! your death the foe demands, and you must leave your wretched mother. That which saves the lives of others, proves your destruction—your father’s nobility; to you your father’s valiancy has proved no gift. O my unlucky bed and marriage, that brought me once to Hector’s home, hoping to be the mother of a son that should rule over Why clutch me with your hands and to my garment cling, nestling like a tender chick beneath my wing? Hector will not rise from the earth and come gripping his famous spear to bring you salvation; no kinsman of your father appears, nor might of Phrygian hosts; one dreadful headlong leap from the dizzy height and you will dash out your life with none to pity you! Oh to clasp your tender limbs, a mother’s fondest joy! Oh to breathe your fragrant breath! In vain it seems these breasts did suckle you, wrapped in your swaddling-clothes; all for nothing I used to toil and wear myself away! Kiss your mother now for the last time, nestle to her that bore you, twine your arms about my neck and join your lips to mine! O you Hellenes, cunning to devise new forms of cruelty, why slay this child who never wronged any? You daughter of Tyndareus, you are no child of Zeus, but I say you were born of many a father, first of some evil demon, next of Envy, then of Murder and of Death, and every horror that the earth breeds. That Zeus was never father of yours I boldly do assert, bane as you have been to many a Hellene and barbarian too. Destruction catch you! Those fair eyes of yours have brought a shameful ruin on the fields of glorious then feast upon his flesh! It is the gods’ will we perish, and I cannot ward the deadly stroke from my child. Hide me and my misery; cast me into the ship’s hold; for it is to a fair wedding I am going, now that I have lost my child! Unhappy Come, child, leave fond embracing of your woeful mother, and mount the high coronal of your ancestral towers, there to draw your parting breath, as is ordained. Take him away. His should the duty be to do such herald’s work, whose heart knows no pity and who loves ruthlessness more than my soul does. O child, son of my hapless boy, an unjust fate robs me and your mother of your life. How is it with me? What can I do for you, luckless one? For you I strike upon my head and beat my breast, my only gift; for that is in my power. Woe for my city! woe for you! What sorrow do we not have? What is wanting now to our utter and immediate ruin? O Telamon, King of who have your home in a seagirt isle that lies near the holy hills where first Athena made the grey olive branch to appear, a crown for heavenly heads and a glory to happy with that great archer, Alcmena’s son, to sack our city When he led the chosen flower of for the steeds, he wasted the masonry squared by Phoebus’ line and chisel, and sacked the land of In vain, it seems, you Phrygian boy the land of your birth is being consumed by fire. The shore re-echoes to our cries; and, as a bird bewails its young, so we bewail our husbands or our children, or our old mothers. The dew-fed springs where you bathed, the course where you trained, are now no more; but you beside the throne of Zeus are sitting with a calm, sweet smile upon your fair young face, while the spear of Ah! Love, Love, who once sought these Dardanian halls, deep-seated in the hearts of heavenly gods, how high you made allying her with deities! But I will cease to urge reproaches against Zeus; for white-winged dawn, whose light is dear to man, turned a baleful eye upon our land and watched the ruin of our citadel, though she had within her bridal bower a husband to give her children, whom once a chariot of gold spangled stars caught up and carried there, great source of hope to his native country ; but all the love the gods once had for Hail! you radiant flare of the sun, by whose fair light I now shall capture her that was my wife, Helen; for I am that Menelaus, who has toiled so hard, I and for, the sake of a woman, but to punish the man who from my house stole my wife, traitor to my hospitality. But he, by the gods’ will, has paid the penalty, ruined, and his country too, by the spear of to call her, though she once was mine—for now she is one among the other Trojan women who share these tents as captives. For they, the very men who who toiled to take her with the spear, have granted to me to slay her, or, if I will, to spare and carry back with me to Ho! my servants, enter the tent, and drag her out to me by her hair foul with murder; and when a favoring breeze shall blow, to O you that do support the earth and rest thereupon, whoever you are, a riddle past our knowledge! Zeus, owhether you are natural necessity, or man’s intellect, to you I pray; for, though you tread over a noiseless path, all your dealings with mankind are guided by justice. What is this? Strange the prayer you offer to the gods! I thank you, Menelaus, if you will slay that wife of yours. Yet shun the sight of her, lest she strike you with longing. For she ensnares the eyes of men, overthrows their towns, and burns their houses, so potent are her witcheries! Well I know her; so do you and those her victims too. Menelaus! this prelude well may fill me with alarm; for I am taken with violence by your servants’ hands and brought before these tents. Still, though I am sure you hate me, yet I want to inquire what you and To judge your case required no great exactness; the army with one consent, that army whom you wronged, handed you over to me to die. May I answer this decision, proving that my death, if I am to die, will be unjust? I came not to argue, but to slay you. Hear her, Menelaus; let her not die for want of that, and let me answer her again, for you know nothing of her villainies in will insure her death against all chance of an escape. This gift needs leisure; still, if she wishes to speak, she may. Yet I will grant her this because of your words, that she may hear them, and not for her own sake. Perhaps you will not answer me, from counting me a foe, whether my words seem good or ill. Yet I will put my charges and yours over against each other, and then reply to the accusations I suppose you will advance against me. First, then, that woman was the author of these troubles by giving birth to so Pallas offered him command of all the Phrygians, and the destruction of and promised him this gift, if she should have the preference over those two for beauty. Now mark the inference I deduce from this; Cypris won the day over the goddesses, and thus far has my marriage proved of benefit to What With no small goddess at his side he came, my evil genius, call him Alexander or Enough of this! For all that followed I must question myself, not you; what thought led me to follow the stranger from your house, traitress to my country and my home? Punish the goddess, show yourself more mighty even than Zeus, who, though he lords it over the other gods, is her slave; therefore I may well be pardoned. Still, from this you might draw a specious argument against me; when That was what I was eager to do; and the warders on the towers and watchmen on the walls can bear me witness, for often they found me seeking to let myself down stealthily by cords from the battlements to master gods, that very wish displays your folly. O my royal mistress, defend your children’s and your country’s cause, bringing to nothing her persuasive arguments, for she pleads well in spite of all her villainy; this is monstrous! First I will take up the cause of those goddesses, and prove how she perverts the truth. For I can never believe that Hera or the maiden Pallas would have been guilty of such folly, the one to sell her coming as they did in mere wanton sport to Ida to contest the palm of beauty. For why should goddess Hera set her heart so much on such a prize? Was it to win a nobler lord than Zeus? or was Athena hunting down among the gods a husband, she who in her dislike of marriage won from her father the gift of remaining unwed? Do not seek to impute folly to the goddesses, in the attempt to adorn your own sin; never will you persuade the wise. Next you have said—what well may make men jeer—that Cypris came with my son to the house of Menelaus. Could she not have stayed quietly in heaven and brought you and Amyclae as well to No! my son was exceedingly handsome, and when you saw him your mind straight became your Aphrodite; for every folly that men commit, they lay upon this goddess, and rightly does her name it was your hope to deluge by your lavish outlay Enough of this! My son carried you off by force, so you say; what Spartan saw this? what cry for help did you ever raise, though Castor was still alive, a vigorous youth, and his brother also, not yet among the stars? Then when you had come to Menelaus’ prowess, you would praise him, to grieve my son, because he had so powerful a rival in his love; but if the Trojans prospered, Menelaus was nothing to you. Your eye was fixed on Fortune, and by such practice you were careful to follow in her steps, careless of virtue’s cause. And then  you assert that you tried to let yourself down from the towers by stealth with twisted cords, as if unwilling to stay? Where were you ever found fastening the noose about your neck, or whetting the knife, as a noble wife would have done in regret for her former husband? And yet often I advised you saying, For you were wantoning in Alexander’s house, wishing to have obeisance done you by barbarians. Yes, it was a proud time for you; and now after all this you have adorned yourself, and come forth and have dared to appear under the same sky as your husband, revolting wretch! Better if you had come in tattered raiment, cowering humbly in terror, with hair cut short, and if your feeling for your past sins were one of shame rather than effrontery. Menelaus, hear the conclusion of my argument; crown Avenge yourself, Menelaus, on your wife, as is worthy of your home and ancestors, clear yourself from the reproach of effeminacy at the lips of Your thoughts coincide with mine, that she, without constraint, left my palace, and sought a stranger’s bed, and now Cypris is introduced for mere bluster. Away to those who shall stone you, and by your speedy death requite the weary toils of the Achaeans, so that you may learn not to bring shame on me! Oh, by your knees, I implore you, do not impute that heaven-sent affliction to me, or slay me; forgive me! Do not betray your allies, whose death this woman caused; on their behalf, and for my children’s sake, I entreat you. Peace, revered lady; to her I pay no heed. I bid my servants take her away, aboard the ship, in which she is to sail. Oh never let her set foot within the same ship as you. Why is that? is she heavier than before? The one who loves once, must love always. Why, that depends how those we love are minded. But your wish shall be granted; she shall not set foot upon the same ship with me; for your advice is surely sound; and when she comes to So then you have delivered into and holy and takes the god’s first rays! Gone are your sacrifices! gone the dancer’s cheerful shout! gone the vigils of the gods as night closed in! your images of carven gold are now no more; and a prey to the furious fiery blast. Ah! my loved husband, you are a wandering spectre; unwashed, unburied lies your corpse, while over the sea the ship sped by wings will carry me to and weep their piteous lamentation; they cry, they cry: Mother, alas! torn from your sight, the Achaeans bear me away from you to their dark ship to row me over the deep to sacred Oh may the sacred blazing thunderbolt of the since he is carrying me away in bitter sorrow from the shores of Never may he reach his home in on the streams of Simois! All me! ah me! new troubles fall on my country, to take the place of those that still are fresh! Behold, you hapless wives of Hecuba, one ship alone delays its plashing oars, and it is soon to sail to the shores of and with him goes Andromache, who drew many tears from me when she set out from the land, wailing her country and crying her farewell to Hector’s tomb. And she begged her master leave to bury this poor dead child of Hector who breathed his last when hurled from the turrets; entreating too that he would not carry this shield, the terror of the Achaeans—this shield with plates of brass with which his father would gird himself—to the home of Peleus or to the same bridal bower where she, Andromache, the mother of this corpse, would be wed, a bitter sight to her, but let her bury the child in it instead of in a coffin of cedar or a tomb of stone, and to your hands commit the corpse that you may deck it with robes and garlands as best you can with your present means; for she is far away and her master’s haste prevented her from burying the child herself. So we, when you have decked the corpse, will heap the earth above and set upon it a spear; but do you with your best speed perform your allotted task; one toil however I have already spared you, for I crossed Scamander’s stream and bathed the corpse and cleansed its wounds. But now I will go to dig a grave for hiin, that our united efforts shortening our task may speed our ship towards home. Place the shield upon the ground, Hector’s shield so deftly rounded, a piteous sight, a bitter grief for me to see. O you Achaeans, more reason have you to boast of your prowess than your wisdom. Why have you in terror of this child been guilty of a murder never matched before? Did you fear that some day he would rear again the fallen walls of you fear a tender child like this! I do not commend the fear of one who fears but never yet has reasoned out the cause. Ah! my beloved, yours is a piteous death indeed! If you had died for your city, when you had tasted of the sweets of manhood, of marriage, and of godlike power over others, then were you blessed, if anything here is blessed. But now after one glimpse, one dream of them, you know them no more, my child, and have no joy of them, though heir to all. Ah, poor child! how sadly have your own father’s walls, those towers that Loxias reared, shorn from your head the locks your mother fondled, and so often caressed, from which through fractured bones the face of murder grins—briefly to dismiss my shocking theme. O hands, how sweet the likeness you retain of his father, and yet you lie Iimp in your sockets before me! Dear mouth, so often full of words of pride, death has closed you, and you have not kept the promise you made, when nestling in my robe, But now I am not to be buried by you, but you, the younger one, a wretched corpse, are buried by me, on whom old age has come with loss of home and children. Ah me, those kisses numberless, the nurture that I gave to you, those sleepless nights—they all are lost! What shall the bard inscribe upon your tomb about you? Argives once for fear of him slew this child? Foul shame should that inscription be to now have you lost your valiant keeper! How fair upon your handle lies his imprint, and on the rim that circles around are marks of sweat, that trickled often from Hector’s brow as he pressed it against his beard in battle’s stress. Come, bring forth, from such store as you have, adornment for the hapless dead, for fortune gives no chance now for lovely offerings; yet of such as I possess, you shall receive these gifts. He is a foolish mortal who thinks his luck secure and so rejoices; for fortune, like a madman in her moods, springs towards this man, then towards that; and no one ever experiences the same unchanging luck. Look! all is ready and they are bringing at your bidding from the spoils of Ah! my child, it is not as victor over your comrades with horse or bow—customs of your life and caused your house to perish root and branch. Woe! thrice woe! my heart is touched, and you the cause, my mighty prince in days now passed! About your body now I swathe this Phrygian robe of honor, which should have clad you on your marriage-day, wedded to the noblest of that the crafty villain Odysseus won. Alas! alas! you, O child, shall earth take to her breast, a cause for bitter weeping. Mourn, you mother! Alas! Wail for the dead. Woe is me! Woe indeed for your unending sorrow! Your wounds in part I will bind up with bandages, a wretched healer in name alone, without reality; but for the rest your father must look to that among the dead. Smite, oh smite upon your head with frequent blow of hand. Woe is me! My kind, good friends— Speak out, Hecuba, the word that was on your lips. It seems the only things that heaven concerns itself about are my troubles and furnishing to bards of after-days a subject for their minstrelsy. Go, bury now in his poor tomb the dead, wreathed all duly as befits a corpse. And yet I think it makes little difference to the dead, if they get a gorgeous funeral; but this is a cause of idle pride to the living. Alas! for your unhappy mother, who over your corpse has closed the high hopes of her life! Born of a noble stock, counted most happy in your lot, ah! what a tragic death is yours! Ha! who are those I see on yonder pinnacles darting to and fro with flaming torches in their hands? Some new calamity wiII soon alight on You captains whose allotted task it is to fire this town of Priam, to you I speak. No longer keep the fire-brand idle in your hands, but launch the flame, that when we have destroyed the city of And you, you sons of follow; for here come servants from Odysseus to fetch you, for to him you are assigned by lot to be a slave far from your country. Ah, woe is me! This surely is the last, the utmost limit, of all my sorrows; I go forth from my land; my city is ablaze with flame. Yet, you aged foot, make one painful struggle to haste, that I may say a farewell to this wretched town. O to slavery. O gods! Yet why do I call on the gods? They did not hearken ever before to our call. Come, let us rush into the flames, for to die with my country in its blazing ruin would be a noble death for me. Your sorrows drive you frantic, poor lady. Go, lead her away, make no delay, for you must deliver her into the hand of Odysseus, conveying to him his prize. Woe! oh woe! Son of Cronos, prince of do you behold our sufferings now, unworthy of the stock of Dardanus? He sees them, but our mighty city is a city no more, and Woe! oh woe! As the smoke soars on wings to heaven, so sinks our city to the ground before the spear. With furious haste both fire and enemy spear devour each house. Oh, earth, nourisher of my children! Ah, ah! Hearken, my children, hear your mother’s voice. You are calling on the dead with voice of lamentation. Yes, as I stretch my aged limbs upon the ground, and beat upon the earth with both my hands. I follow you and kneel, invoking from the nether world my hapless husband. I am being dragged and hurried away— The sorrow, the sorrow of that cry! To dwell beneath a master’s roof! From my own country! Woe is me! O Priam, Priam, slain, unburied, left without a friend, nothing do you know of my cruel fate. No, for over his eyes black death has drawn his pall, a pure man slain by the impure. Woe for the temples of the gods and for our dear city! Ah, ah! Murderous flame and enemy spear are now your lot. Soon will you tumble to your own loved soil, and be forgotten. And the dust, mounting to heaven on wings like smoke, will rob me of the sight of my home. The name of my country wiII pass into obscurity; all is scattered far and wide, and hapless Troy has ceased to be. Did you know, did you hear? Yes, it was the crash of the citadel. The shock, the shock— Will overwhelm our city utterly. O woe is me! trembling, quaking limbs, support my footsteps! away! to face the day that begins your slavery. Woe for our unhappy town! And yet let us advance to the Achaean fleet.  \n",

But well I know, even before I have passed away to Hades’ domain, that my life is ill-fortuned and heavy. For I, while still dwelling in the house of my father Oeneus at who in three shapes was always asking me from my father—coming now as a bull in visible form, now as a serpent, sheeny and coiled, now ox-faced with human trunk, while from his thick-shaded beard wellheads of fountain-water sprayed. In the expectation that such a suitor would get me, I was always praying in my misery that I might die, before I should ever approach that marriage-bed. closed with him in combat and delivered me.  The manner of their fighting I cannot clearly recount.  I know it not, but if there be anyone who watched that sight without trembling, he might give an account of it.  But I, as I sat there, was struck with terror, lest my beauty should win me sorrow in the end.  But Zeus, Arbiter of Contests, accomplished a good ending—if indeed it was good.  For since being joined with Heracles as his chosen bride, I nourish one fear after another in my anxiety for him.  One night brings distress, and the next night, in turn, drives it out.  Children, furthermore, were born to us, whom at the time he looked at only as the farmer looks at a distant field, visiting it only once to sow seed and once to reap.  Such was the manner of his life, ever sending him to and from our home in servitude to some master. in the home of a foreign host.  But where Heracles is, no one knows.  I only know that he is gone, and has caused me sharp pain for him.  I am almost sure that he has come to some suffering.  The interval has not been brief;  rather, he is unheard from ten months already, plus another five.  Yes, there has been some terrible misfortune.  That tablet which he left with me before departing suggests it to me.  I often pray to the gods that I did not receive it to my misfortune. Deianeira, my mistress, many are the times already that I have observed you mourning the departure of Heracles with great weeping and lamentation.  But now—if it is proper to school the free-born with the doctrines of a slave, and if I am obliged to point out what you should do—how is it that you so abound in sons, yet you do not send one of them to seek your husband, especially Hyllus?  It would be appropriate to send him, if he cared for his father’s sake that he be deemed to fare well.  Here he is now, dashing to the house in timely stride.  So if in your eyes I speak in season, you can use both my counsel and the man. My child, my son, wise words fall, it seems, from humble lips.  For this woman is a slave, but her advice is worthy of the free. What sort of advice, Mother?  Tell me, if I may be told. It brings shame, she says, that you have not sought to learn of your father and where he is, when he has been abroad for so long. But I know where, if one can put any trust in rumors. And in what region, my child, do you hear that he has settled? Last year, they say, through all its length, he toiled as a slave to a Lydian woman. If he endured even that, then one might believe any and all rumors. Well, he has been released from that service, as I hear. Where, then, is he reported to be now—alive, or dead? He is waging or yet planning a war, they say, upon Are you aware, my son, that he has left with me sure oracles concerning that land? What are they, mother?  I do not know the oracles you mean. They read that either he shall meet the end of his life, or, after taking on this contest, he shall thereafter, at least, enjoy a happy life for its duration.  And so, my child, when his fate is thus trembling in the balance, will you not go to assist him?  For we are saved, if he finds safety, or we perish along with him. I will go, Mother.  Had I known the substance of these prophecies, I would have long been at his side.  As it was, my father’s usual good fortune did not allow me to fear for him, nor to be overly anxious. Now that I have the knowledge, I will spare no pains to learn the whole truth in this matter. Go, then, my son.  For prosperity yields advantage even for him who learns of it late. You, to whom Night gives birth when she is vanquished and despoiled of her starry crown, and whom, as you blaze, she lays to rest, I pray you, O Sun, Sun, tell me, where is Alcmena’s son, where dwells her child?  O Shining god with your bright flash, is he on the straits of the sea, or does he lean upon the twin continents?  Speak, you who surpass all in sight! For with longing heart, as I hear, Deianeira, the battle-prize, now, like some mournful bird, never rests her eyes’ longing that they might be without tears, but nourishing a well-remembered fear for her husband’s travels she is constantly afflicted by her anxious, widowed marriage-bed and in her misery anticipates misfortune. For just as one may see billow after billow advancing and passing over the wide deep before the tireless south-wind, or the north, so the great toil of his life, stormy as the Cretan sea, now whirls back the heir of Cadmus, now exalts him.  But some god always keeps him unerring from the house of Hades. With respect I reproach you for your weeping, but still I will speak in dissent. You must not, I say, wear away fair hope.  Remember that the all-accomplishing king, the son of Cronus, does not appoint a painless lot for mortals.  Sorrow and joy revolve to all, as the stars of the Bear move in their circling paths. Starry night does not remain constant with men, nor does tribulation, nor wealth;  in a moment it is gone from us, and to another in his turn come both gladness and bereavement.  So I urge even you, our Queen, to keep these matters firmly in your outlook.  You must, for who has known Zeus to be so without care for his children? You have heard of my trouble, I would guess, and that has brought you here.  But the anguish which consumes my heart—may you never come to know it through your own experience!—to that now you are total strangers.  Yes, a young life grows in those sheltered regions of its own, and the Sun-god’s heat disturbs it not, nor rain, nor any wind.  Rather it takes up a toilless existence amidst pleasure, until such time as she is called “wife” instead of “maiden”, and takes her portion of anxious thoughts in the night, fearing for husband or for children.  At that point a woman could understand the burden of my misfortunes by recalling her own experience. When lord Heracles was setting out from home on his last journey, he left in the house an ancient tablet, inscribed with signs which he had never before brought himself to explain to me when going out on one of his many labors. He had always departed as if to conquer, not to die.  But now, as if he were a doomed man, he told me what I should take for my marriage portion, and what share of their father’s land he wished divided for his children.  And he fixed the time for the division, saying that, when he had been gone from our land for a year and three months, he was fated either to die at that time, or by escaping the end of the period to live thereafter an untroubled life.  That, he explained, was the fate ordained by the gods to be the end of the labors of Heracles just as, he said, the ancient oak at As a result I leap up from sweet sleep in fear, dear maidens, terrified at the possibility that I must remain widowed of the noblest man of all. Hush—no more ill-omened words!  I see a man approaching who is crowned with garlands as if for joyous news. Queen Deianeira, I shall be the first messenger to free you from fear.  Know that Alcmena’s son lives and triumphs, and from battle brings the first-fruits to the gods of this land. What news is this, old man, that you give me? That your much-admired husband will soon come to your house, revealed in his victorious might. From what citizen or what stranger did you learn these tidings? In the meadow, the summer haunt of oxen, Lichas the herald is proclaiming it to many.  From him I heard it, and dashed away so that, in all honesty, having been the first to report this news, I might profit in some way by you and win your favor. And why is he not here, if he is so successful? He does not, my lady, enjoy ease of movement.  The entire Malian populace stands about him in a circle and questions him, and he cannot move forward.  Each person is bent on learning according to his desire, and will not release the man until he has heard his pleasure.  Thus against his wishes, but in keeping with theirs, he is with them.  Yet you will soon see him face to face. O Zeus, ruler of the sacred uncut meadow of Oeta, at last, though after much delay, you have given us joy!  Uplift your voices, you women within the house and you beyond our gates, since now we enjoy the brightness of this message, which has risen on us beyond my hope! Let the brides of tomorrow raise a joyous cry for the house with shouts of triumph at the hearth.  Among them let the yell of the men go up in unison for Apollo of the bright quiver, our defender!  And at the same time, maidens, lift up a paean, cry aloud to his sister, Ortygian Artemis, huntress of deer, goddess with torch in each hand, and to the nymphs her neighbors! Quickly it wheels me round in Bacchus’s race!  Oh, oh, Paean!  Look, dear lady!  All is taking shape, plain to see, before your gaze. I see it, dear maidens;  the sight has not escaped my watchful eyes.  I see that procession. I bid the herald joyous welcome after his long absence!—if indeed you bring anything that gives joy. We are happy in our return, and happy in your greeting, lady, in accordance with the deed achieved.  For when a man has fair fortune, it is his right to win good welcome. Most welcome man, tell me first what first I would know—shall I receive Heracles alive? I certainly left him alive and well, in vigorous health, unburdened by disease. Where, tell me—in his ancestral land, or on barbarian soil? There is a headland of In payment of a vow, or at the command of an oracle? For a vow, made when he was seeking to conquer and plunder the country of these women whom you see before you. And these—who are they, by the gods, and whose daughters?  They deserve pity, unless their misfortune deceives me. These are captives whom he selected as choice spoils for himself and for the gods when he sacked the city of Eurytus. Was it in fact the war against that city which kept him away so long, beyond all forecast, past all count of days? No.  The greater part of the time he was detained in but sold into servitude.  No offense should be taken at my tale, lady, when the deed is found to be Zeus’ work.  He passed a whole year, as he himself says, a bought slave to the barbarian Omphale.  And so stung was he by the shame of it, that he bound himself by a solemn oath, swearing one day to enslave with wife and child the man who had brought that suffering upon him.  And not in vain did he speak the oath;  but, when he had been purified, he gathered a mercenary army and went against the city of Eurytus.  For, Heracles asserted, that man alone of mortals had a share in causing his suffering.  For when Heracles, a guest-friend of long standing, came to his house and hearth, Eurytus roared against him with insults of ruinous intent, saying that, although Heracles had inevitable shafts in his hands, he fell short of his own sons in the contest of the bow.  Next he shouted that Heracles was a freeman’s slave, a broken hulk, and then at a banquet, when his guest was full of wine, he tossed him from his home. when afterward Iphitus came to the hill of the father of all, Olympian Zeus, sent him away to be sold, and did not tolerate that this once, he killed a man by guile.  Had he achieved his vengeance openly, Zeus would surely have pardoned him the righteous triumph. For the gods do not love criminal behavior either. are sent here to you.  For that was your husband’s command, which I, his faithful servant, perform.  As for the man himself, know that he will come, once he has made pure sacrifice to Zeus of his fathers for the sacking of the city.  After all the good news that has been told, this, indeed, is the sweetest word to hear. Now, O Queen, your joy is plainly revealed;  part is with you, and of the rest you have foreknowledge. Yes, how would I not rejoice with dutiful spirit, when I hear of my husband’s successful venture? My rejoicing is bound to keep pace with his success.  And yet a prudent mind can see room for fear, lest he who prospers should one day stumble.  For a strange pity came over me, friends, at the sight of these ill-fated exiles, homeless and fatherless in a foreign land.  Though they were once the daughters perhaps of freeborn men, they now live the life of slaves.  O Zeus, god who turns the tide of battle, may I never see you stalking against a child of my line on any occasion; no, if you do some such thing, let it not be while I am still alive!  So great is my fear, as I look upon these girls. Why would I know?  Why would you ask me?  Perhaps she is the offspring of not the lowest family in that land. Can she be of the ruling family?  Was she a child of Eurytus? I do not know;  I did not in fact make a long investigation. And you do not know her name from one of her fellow captives? No, indeed.  In silence I completed my task. Unhappy girl, tell it to me, anyway, from your own mouth.  It is indeed distressing to me not to know who you are. It will not, I assure you, be at all on a par with time past if she moves her lips.  She has not said a word, large or small, but has been constantly laboring with the heavy pains of her misfortune and weeping, poor girl, since she left her windswept fatherland.  Her condition is indeed bad—for her, anyway—but claims our forbearance. Then let her be left in peace, and go beneath our roof as it pleases her.  Let her not in addition to her existing troubles take fresh grief from me;  she has enough already.  Now let us all go in, so that you may go speedily on your journey, while I make all things ready in the house. Do go in, but first remain here a short while, so that you may learn, apart from these others, who they are whom you take into your home, and gain necessary knowledge of the facts which you have not heard.  For of these I am in full possession. What do you mean?  Why do you stay my departure? Stop and listen.  My former report was not a waste of your time, and neither, I believe, will this one be. Shall I call those others back again?  Or do you wish to speak before me and these women? To you and the women I can speak freely.  Never mind the others. Well, they are gone.  Now let your speech signal your meaning. That man Lichas spoke nothing of what he just told you in strict accordance with the truth.  He was just now lying, or else he was dishonest in his earlier report. What do you say?  Explain to me clearly all that you mean, for I cannot understand what you said. I heard this man declare, before many witnesses, that it was for the sake of this girl that Heracles overthrew Eurytus and the high towers of alone of the gods, enchanted him into doing those deeds of arms, not the toilsome servitude to Omphale in to give him the girl for his secret concubine, he devised some petty complaint as a pretext, and made war upon her fatherland, in which, as the herald said, that Eurytus ruled.  He killed the king, her father, and sacked her city.  And now, as you see, he makes his return, sending her to this house not without consideration, lady, and not as if she were to be a slave.  No, do not expect that;  it is not likely, if his heart has been kindled with desire.  On this account, my Queen, I resolved to reveal to you all that I had heard from that man.  Many others were listening to it, as I was, in the public place where the Trachinians were assembled, so they can convict him.  If my words are unwelcome, I am grieved;  but nevertheless I have spoken the truth. Ah, misery!  What is happening to me?  What secret plague have I welcomed beneath my roof?  Ah, me!  So, she was born without a name, as her escort swore? No, illustrious by name, as by birth; she is the daughter of Eurytus, and was once called Iole.  But he could say nothing of her birth, because, of course, he made no investigation. May destruction seize not all wrongdoers—no, only the man who practices stealthy wrongdoing that is shameful to his rank! Ah, friends, what should I do?  I am dumbstruck by this latest news! Go and question Lichas, since he might tell the truth, if you were willing to compel him by threat of force to answer. I will go.  Your advice does not lack good judgment. And I, shall I wait here?  Or what do you require? Stay here—since he is coming out from the house without my summons, but of his own accord. My lady, what message shall I bear to Heracles?  Instruct me, for, as you see, I am going. How quickly you rush away, when your arrival had been so tardy—before we have even resumed our talk. Well, if there is anything you must ask, I am at your service. Will you indeed give me the honest truth? Yes, be great Zeus my witness—in anything that I know. Who is the woman, then, whom you escorted here? She is Euboean.  But whose offspring, I cannot say. You there, look at me.  To whom do you think you speak? And you, to what end have you asked me such a question? Dare to answer my question, if you are sensible. I speak to the royal Deianeira, daughter of Oeneus, wife of Heracles and, unless my eyes deceive me, my mistress. The very word that I wished to hear from you—you admit that she is your mistress? Yes, it is only right to do so. Well, then, what penalty would you think it right to pay, if you should be found to be behaving wrongly towards her? Wrongly?  What fiction have you created? None.  Rather it is you, to be sure, who do this. I am leaving—I was foolish to listen to you so long. No, not until you have answered a small question. Speak, if you require something.  You are not the silent type. That captive, whom you escorted into the house, you know whom I mean? Yes.  But why do you ask? Did you not avow that she, on whom you look as if in ignorance, was Iole, the seed of Eurytus, your captive? To whom on earth did I say it?  Who and where is the man who heard me say it and will be your witness? To many of our own citizens you said it.  In the public gathering of  Trachinians a great crowd heard this much, at least, from you. Sure, they said they heard.  But it does not amount to the same thing to tell one’s fancy and to give an accurate report. What do you mean, fancy!  Did you not speak on your oath when you said that you were bringing her as a bride for Heracles? I?  Bringing a bride?  In the name of the gods, dear mistress, tell me who on earth this stranger is? I am a man who heard from your own lips that the conquest of the whole city was due to desire for this girl and that the Lydian woman did not destroy it, but the passion which arose for the girl. Lady, send this creature away. To babble with the insane is not the mark of a sensible man. No, I implore you by Zeus whose strikes lightning down along the high glens of Oeta, do not rob me of a true report!  Your words will not fall on the ears of a cruel woman, nor has she yet to learn the fate of humanity, how by our nature we are often inconstant in our pleasures.  He does not use good sense, then, who like a boxer opposes the blows of Eros.  For Eros rules the gods as he pleases, and he rules me as well—that is certain.  Why not another woman, just like me? And so I am crazed indeed, if I blame my husband because that disease has seized him or because he was seized by this woman, his partner in a thing which is no shame to them, and no wrong to me.  Impossible!  If it was from him that you learned to lie, it was not a noble lesson.  But if you are your own teacher in this, you will be seen as cruel when it is your wish to prove kind.  No, tell me the whole truth, since to a free-born man the name of liar attaches like an ugly stain. If your hope is to escape detection, that cannot come to pass:  many are those whom you told and who will inform me.  And if you are afraid, your fear is mistaken, since it is not learning the truth that would pain me.  But to know it, what is terrible in that?  Has Heracles not all by himself already mated with a multitude of other women?  And never yet has one of them come away with a harsh word or reproach from me, nor shall this girl, even if she should melt in her passion.  Indeed, I felt a profound pity when I saw her because her beauty has destroyed her life, and she, unfortunate one, has against her will devastated her fatherland and enslaved it. Obey her good and kind advice, and hereafter you will neither have cause to complain of this lady, nor lack my thanks. Indeed, then, dear mistress.  Since I see that you think as mortals should think and not without good judgment, I will tell you the whole truth, and not hide it. Yes, it is just as this one says.  That terrible longing for the girl long ago shot through Heracles, and for her sake the desolate he never ordered me to conceal the fact and never denied it.  Instead I, lady, fearing to wound your heart by such news, erred—if you regard this in any way an error. for his sake and for yours equally bear with the woman, and be willing that the gentle words which you spoke about her have been spoken unalterably.  For though by the strength of his hands he is victorious in all else, Heracles has been utterly subdued by his passion for this girl. My own thoughts move me to act as you advise.  Rest assured that I will not earn another affliction for myself by waging a fruitless fight against the gods.  But let us go into the house, so that you may carry him my messages and since gifts should be given in due recompense for gifts received, so that you may take these also.  It would not be right that you should go back with empty hands, after coming with such a rich cargo. Great and mighty is the victory which the Cyprian queen always bears away.  I bypass the tales of the gods, and do not narrate how she beguiled the son of Cronus, and Hades, the lord of darkness, or Poseidon, shaker of the earth.  But, when this bride was to be won, who were the massive rivals that entered the contest for her nuptials?  Who stepped forward to the ordeal of battle full of blows and raising dust? One was a mighty river-god, the form of a bull, high-horned and four-legged, Achelous, from Oeniadae.  The other came from and the Cyprian goddess of nuptial joy was there with them, acting as sole umpire. There was clatter of fists and clang of bow and crash of a bull’s horns mixed together; then there were close-locked grapplings and deadly  blows from foreheads and loud deep cries from both.  Meanwhile the delicate beauty sat on the side of a hill that could be seen from afar, awaiting the husband that would be hers. like an orphaned calf. Dear friends, while our guest is saying his farewell to the captive girls in the house, I have stolen away partly to tell you what these hands have devised, and partly to grieve over my sufferings in your company. a single bedspread for one man’s embrace.  Such is the reward that Heracles has sent me—he whom I called true and loyal—for guarding his home through all that long time.  I do not know how to be angry with him, even though he is infected with this disease. But, then again, to live with her, sharing the same marriage—what woman could endure it?  For I see that the flower of her youth is blossoming, while mine is fading.  The eyes of men love to pluck off the bloom of youth, but they turn their steps from the old. On this account I am afraid lest Heracles, in name my husband, should be the younger woman’s man. I had a gift, an old one given to me by a monster of long ago, and kept it hidden in a bronze urn.  While yet a girl, I took this gift from the shaggy-chested Nessus—from his lifeblood, as he lay dying.  He is the one who used to carry men in his arms for hire across the deep current of the Evenus, using no oar for conveyance, nor ship’s sail.  He carried me, too, on his shoulders, when at my father’s sending, I first departed with Heracles as his wife.  When I was in midstream, he touched me with lewd hands.  I shrieked, and straightaway the son of Zeus turned round and with his hands shot a feathered arrow that whistled right through his chest to the lungs.  As he passed away the monster spoke these few words:  “Child of aged Oeneus, you will have this benefit from my ferrying, if you obey me, since you were the last whom I carried.  If you gather with your hands the blood clotted round my wound, at the place where the Hydra, you will have a charm for the heart of Heracles, so that he will never look upon any woman and love her more than you.” I have imbued this robe with it, applying to it all that he instructed while he lived.  The work is finished.  May deeds of wicked daring always be far from my thoughts and from my knowledge, as I detest the women who attempt them!  But if in any way I may prevail against this girl by love-spells and the charms used on Heracles, the means to that end have been devised—unless I seem to be acting rashly.  If so, I will stop immediately. On the contrary.  If there is any reason for confidence in these actions, we think that your plan is not wrong. My reason for confidence is this:  there is the appearance of success in the plan.  But the proof I have not yet essayed. Your knowledge must come after you act.  For you can have no test which is not fanciful except by making the attempt. Well, we shall know shortly, for there I see the man already at the doors.  He will soon depart.  Only I ask that I may be well sheltered by you!   When you accomplish even shameful deeds under the cover of darkness, you will never fall into disgrace. What are your instructions?  Tell me, daughter of Oeneus, for already I am tardy because of my long stay. In fact I have just been seeing to this very thing for you, Lichas, while you were addressing the foreign women in the house:  take for me this long robe, prepared by my own hand, a gift to my absent husband.  Give it to him and tell him to be sure that no man puts it on his body before him and that it not be seen by the light of the sun, nor by the sacred precinct, nor by the blaze at the hearth, until he stands conspicuous before all eyes and shows it clearly to the gods on a day for the sacrifice of bulls. For so had I vowed, that if I should ever see or hear that he had come safely home, I would dutifully adorn him with this robe and reveal him to the god as a new sacrificer in new garb.  As proof of your commission you will carry a token which he will easily recognize within the circle of this seal. If I practice Hermes’ art of heraldry with any skill, I certainly will never slip up while doing your errand.  I will not fail to carry and present this chest in the same condition, nor to add to it the proper assurance of the reasons which you have for sending it. You may go now, for you know well how things are with us in the house. I know and will report that all is well. And you know, further, from your own eyes my greeting to the foreign girl, how I welcomed her warmly. So much so that my heart was struck with joy. What more, then, is there for you to tell him?  I am afraid that it would be too soon to speak of the longing on my part, before I know if I am longed for there. O you who dwell by the warm springs near ships’ haven and rocky cliff, and you who live by the crags of Oeta!  And you dwellers by the land-locked waters of the Malian gulf, and the headland sacred to the virgin-goddess of the golden shuttle, where are the famed councils of the Greeks at the gates! Soon the glorious voice of the flute will go up for you again, sounding no bothersome, strident notes, but divine music worthy of the lyre!  For the son whom Alcmena bore to Zeus is hurrying homeward, with spoils won by supreme valor. We thought him lost utterly to our land, a wanderer over sea, while we waited through twelve long months and knew nothing. She, his loving wife, miserable, was ever pining in her miserable heart, always weeping.  But now Ares, stung to rage, has freed her days from their toil. May he come, may he come!  Let him not halt the many-oared ship that carries him before he has reached this town, leaving the island altar where he is reported to be sacrificing! May he come from there full of desire, steeped in love on the pretext of the robe by Persuasion’s all-powerful ointment! Friends, how I fear that I may have gone too far in all that I was doing just now! What has happened, Deianeira, daughter of Oeneus? I do not know, but I despair that I will soon be found to have done a great wrong, when my hope was for good. Surely it is nothing that bears on your gift to Heracles? Yes, it is!  So much so that I would never recommend to anybody that he be eager for action in obscurity. Tell us the cause of your fear, if it may be told. A thing has happened, my friends, such that, if I declare it, it will be a strange marvel for you to hear.  The implement with which I was just now anointing the festal robe, a white tuft of fleecy sheep’s wool, has disappeared, eaten away by no animal in the courtyard, but self-devoured and self-destroyed it crumbled down over a stone slab.  But I must tell the story at greater length, so that you may know exactly how this thing was accomplished. I neglected no part of the precepts which the savage Centaur gave me when he was hurting from the bitter barb in his side;  they were in my memory, like the graven words which no hand may wash from a tablet of bronze.  Now this was his order to me, and I obeyed it: to keep this potion hidden in inmost recesses always away from fire and untouched by the sun’s warm ray, until I should apply it, newly spread, where I wished.  So I had done.  And just now, when the moment for action had come, I performed the anointing secretly in the rooms of the house with a tuft of soft wool which I had plucked from a sheep of our home-flock;  then I folded up my gift, and laid it, unvisited by sunlight, within its hollow chest, as you saw.  But as I am going back into the house, I see a thing inexplicable by words and beyond the knowledge of the human mind to understand. For somehow I happened to have thrown the ball of wool, with which I had been anointing the robe, into the full blaze of the sun’s rays.  As it grew warm, it ran all into confusion, and quickly crumbled to powder on the ground, like nothing in appearance so much as the morsels left by a saw’s teeth when wood is cut.  It lies just so, fallen.  And from the earth, where it lay exposed, clotted foam seethes up, like the rich juice of the blue fruit from the vine of Bacchus when it is poured on the ground. Fear is necessary when terrible deeds are done, but one should not judge one’s expectations before the outcome is known. There is no room for expectation when one’s plans are bad, at least the kind of expectation which lends confidence. And yet in the case of those whose mistakes were unwitting, men’s anger is softened.  So it should be for you. No, such words are not for one who took part in the wrongdoing, but only for him who has no trouble at his own door. It would suit you to refrain from saying anything more, unless you would reveal anything to your own son.  For he is here, the one who earlier went to seek his father. O Mother, how I wish I could choose one of three fates for you! I wish that you no longer lived, or, if you remained, that someone else called you “Mother”, or that some new and kinder heart had been exchanged for your present one! My son, what have I done to cause your hate? Listen to me!  You have killed your husband, my father—my father! oh, no!  What is this you have blurted out, Hyllus? Only what cannot but be fulfilled.  For who could undo what has happened? What do you mean, son?  From whom did you hear this that you charge me with a crime so awful? I have seen my father’s overwhelming misfortune with my own eyes.  I did not learn of it by hearsay. Where did you find him? Where were you with him? If you need to hear, then I must tell all. After sacking the famous city of Eurytus, he went his way with the trophies and choice spoils of victory.  There is a sea-washed headland of There I first saw him, to the gratification of my desire.  He was about to make a sacrifice rich in offerings when his own herald, Lichas, came to him from home with your gift, the deadly robe, in his hands.  This he put on as you prescribed and then began his offering with twelve bulls, free from blemish, the prime of the spoil;  but altogether he brought a hundred mixed victims to the altar.  At first the miserable wretch prayed with serene soul and rejoiced in his ornate garb. But when the blood-fed flame began to blaze from the holy offerings and from the resinous pine, a sweat broke out on his skin and the tunic clung to his sides close-glued at every joint, as if by a craftsman’s hand;  there came a convulsive, biting pain in his bones;  and then the venom, like that of some deadly, cruel viper, began to devour him.  At that he shouted for the ill-fated Lichas—who was in no way to blame for your crime—asking by what plots he had brought that robe. But he, unfortunate one, all-unknowing, said that he had brought your gift from you alone, just as it had been sent.  When Heracles heard it, just as a piercing spasm clutched his lungs, he caught him by the foot where the ankle bends in the socket and threw him at a surf-beaten rock in the sea, causing the white brain to ooze from his hair, when the crown of his head had been scattered and his blood with it. Why do you leave without a word?  Do you not know that your silence pleads your accuser’s case? Let her leave.  May a fair wind speed her far from my sight!  Why should she falsely keep the dignity of the name “Mother,” when she is all unlike a mother in her deeds?  No, let her go—farewell to her.  May such delight as she gives my father become her own! See, maidens, how suddenly the divine word of the old prophecy has closed upon us, which allotted this destiny:  that when the twelfth year with its full complement of months should have come to an end, it would complete the undertaking of toils for the true-born son of Zeus!  And that promise rides before a steady wind to sure fulfillment.  For how shall he who does not see the light of day ever have toilsome servitude any more in death? For if the Centaur’s deceitful torture smears his sides with a murderous net, where clings the venom which Death birthed and the gleaming serpent nourished, how can he look upon tomorrow’s sun, when that appalling Hydra-shape grasps him?  Those murderous goads, prepared by the deceptive words of black-haired Nessus, torment him with confused thrashing and seethe on his skin. In these matters this miserable lady had no apprehension, when she foresaw in the new marriage a great plague swiftly rushing upon her household.  Her own hand applied the drug.  But no doubt for the results yielded by a stranger’s counsel, given at a fatal meeting—for these she despairingly groans and sheds a tender dew of thickly-falling tears. And the coming fate foreshadows a great disaster, contrived by guile. Our streaming tears break forth.  Ah, no!  An infection pours over him, an illness more to be pitied than any suffering that adversaries ever brought upon that glorious hero.  Ah, you dark head of the spear foremost in battle, who by your mighty point recently led that swift bride from But the Cyprian goddess, ministering in silence, has been plainly proved the author of these deeds. Is it fancy, or did I just now hear some cry of grief rushing through the house? What is this? It is no uncertain sound, but a wail of anguish from inside.  The house has some new trouble. And note how strangely, with what consternation on her brow that old woman approaches to give us some news. Ah, my daughters, great, indeed, are the sorrows for us that began with the gift sent to Heracles! Old woman, what new trouble have you to tell? Deianeira has departed on the last of all her journeys, departed without stirring a foot. Surely you do not mean she is dead? My tale is told. Dead, the poor woman? Again you hear me affirm it. Poor, lost one!  Tell me, what was the manner of her death? Oh, it was most cruel in its execution! Speak, woman, with what end did she meet? She destroyed herself. What impulse drove her?  What disease of her mind seized her on the point of its evil shaft?  How did she contrive this death upon death, accomplishing it all on her own? By a stroke of the sword which gives cause for mourning. Did you witness that violent deed, poor helpless one? I did, yes, since I was standing close by. What was it?  How was it done?  Oh, speak! Of her own accord she set her hand to the deed. What are you saying? The certain truth. The firstborn, the firstborn of that newly arisen bride is a great Erinys on this house! Too true.  And had you been close at hand and seen her do it, you would have pitied her even more. And could a woman’s hand dare to carry out such deeds? Yes, with fierce daring.  You shall hear, and then you will bear me witness. When she came alone into the house and saw her son preparing a deep litter in the court, with which to go back and meet his father, she hid herself where none would see. Falling before the altars, she moaned that they were left desolate, and whenever she touched any household thing that she, poor lady, had habitually used in the past, her tears would flow.  If, as she roamed hither and thither through the house, she beheld the form of any well-loved servant, she wept in misery at the sight, crying aloud upon her own fate, and her childless existence thereafter. when I saw her spread coverings on the bedstead of Heracles.  When she had done this, she sprang up on them and sat in the middle of the bed.  Then she broke out in warm streams of tears and said:  “Ah, my bridal bed and bridal chamber, farewell now and for ever, since you will never more receive me in these covers as his wife.”  She says no more, but with a vehement hand she loosens her robe where the brooch of beaten gold lies above her breasts and bares all her left side and arm.  Then I run with all my strength, and warn her son of her intent.  But even in the space between my going and our return, we find that she has driven a two-edged sword up through her side to the heart.  At that sight, her son gave a great cry.  For he knew, poor boy, that in his anger he had driven her to that action.  He had learned too late from the servants in the house that she had acted without knowledge and at the will of the monster.  Then and there the youth in his misery left no cry of grief unmade as he lamented over her, nor as he fell to kiss her lips;  he threw himself at her side, loudly moaning that he had rashly attacked her with a false accusation and weeping that he must now live orphaned of both alike, of his father and of her. There is no tomorrow, until today is safely past. Which disaster shall I bewail first? Which is more to be pitied?  In my grief I cannot decide. One sorrow may be seen in the house;  for one we wait with apprehension.  To have and to await are one and the same. oh, that some strong breeze, a fair wind, might arise at our hearth to bear me far from this land, so that I might not die of terror when I look but once upon the mighty seed of Zeus!  For they say that he is approaching  the house in torments from which there is no deliverance, a wonder of unutterable woe. Ah, he was not far off, but close to us, he for whom I cried in advance, like the shrill nightingale!  Here is a foreign procession of strange men.   And in what manner, then, do they bring him?  In sorrow, as for some loved one, they tread their mournful, noiseless tread.  Ah, he is carried on in silence! Should I think that he is dead, or just asleep? O my father!  O my misery!  What is to become of me?  What is my best plan?  Ah! Hush, young man!  Do not rouse the cruel pain that infuriates your father!  He lives, though on the very edge.  Bite your tongue and hold it! What do you say, old man—is he alive? You must not awake the slumberer!  You must not rouse and revive his fierce, recurrent infection, my son! But the immense weight of this misery crushes me.  My heart craves release! O Zeus, in what land am I?  Among what people do I lie, tortured with unending agonies?  O me, what pain!  Oh, that accursed pest gnaws me once more! Did I not know how much better it was that you should keep silent, instead of scattering sleep from his brain and eyes? No, I know no way to be patient when I witness this misery. O Cenaean rock, foundation of my altars, what cruel reward you have earned me for those fair offerings, O Zeus!  Ah, in what ruin you have deposited me, in what ruin!  Would that I had never looked on you to my sorrow with my eyes, never come face to face with this blooming madness, which no spell can soothe! Where is the enchanter, where the practiced healer, save Zeus alone, who will charm this catastrophe away?  I would be amazed if I saw him from even a great distance! Ah! Leave me!  Leave me in my misfortune!  Leave me to sleep my last. Where, where do you touch me?  Where do you lay me?  You will kill me, you will kill me!  If there was any pain that slumbered, you have aroused it! It has seized me,—oh, the pest comes again!—What is your homeland, you men most ungrateful of all the Greeks?  I wore out my wretched days in ridding the Greeks of pests both on the deep and throughout every forest.  And now, when I am afflicted, will no man turn merciful fire or sword on me? Oh!  Oh!  Will no one come and strike the head from this accursed body with one fierce stroke?  Ah, me! You are the man’s son, and this task exceeds my strength.  Help him, for the strength to save him is at your command, more than mine. My hands reach out to him, but no resource in myself or from another can help me make his life forget its agonies.  So strong is the destiny appointed by Zeus! O my son, where are you? Raise me, take hold of me here, here!  Oh, oh, my god! Again, again the cruel pest leaps, leaps up to rend me, the wild, uncombatable plague!  O Pallas, Pallas, it tortures me again!  oh, please, my son, pity your sire!  Draw a sword—you will not be blamed for it—strike me beneath my collarbone. Heal this pain with which your godless mother has enraged me!  So may I see her fall to ruin, exactly, just exactly, as she has destroyed me! Sweet Hades, brother of Zeus, give me sleep, give me sleep.  Kill me in my misery by a swift-flying doom! I shudder, friends, to hear these sorrows which our King suffers.  What a man is here, and what misfortunes lash at him! Ah, many and hot and cruel not in name alone have been the labors of these hands, the burdens hoisted upon these shoulders!  And yet no toil ever laid on me by the bedfellow of Zeus or by the hateful Eurystheus was as harsh as this thing which the daughter of Oeneus, fair and false, has fastened upon my back, this woven net of the Erinyes in which I perish!  Plastered to my sides, it has eaten away my inmost flesh and sucks the channels of my lungs, making my body its home.  Already it has drunk  away my fresh lifeblood, and my whole body is wasted, conquered by these indescribable bonds.  Not spearmen on the battlefield, nor the Giants’ earth-born army, nor the might of savage beasts, not and do not honor your mother’s name above your father’s.  Bring out the woman that bore you, and give her with your own hands into my hand, that I may know for certain which sight grieves you more—my tortured frame, or hers, when she suffers her just punishment! Go, my son, be bold!  Show your pity for me, whom many might think deserving of pity—pity me moaning and weeping like a girl!  No one could say that he had ever seen this man do that before.  No, always without complaint I used to pursue my troubles. But now in my misery I have been found a woman, instead of the man I used to be. Ah, unhappy Father, since your pause permits an answer, hear me, diseased though you are;  I will ask you for no more than is my due.  Give yourself to me in a mood not as harsh as that to which your heart is now stung.  Otherwise you cannot learn in what circumstances you wrongly wish to triumph and wrongly show resentment. Stop when you have said what it is you desire.  In this pain of mine I understand none of your many riddles. I come to tell you of my mother—her present circumstances and how she erred unknowingly. You corrupt thing!  Have you indeed mentioned her name again, the name, “Mother, Murderess of Father,” in my hearing? Yes, for her condition is such that my silence shames me. No, it does not shame you, when you consider her past crimes. You will not say so, at least in view of her deeds today. Speak—but take care that you not be found corrupt. I will speak.  She is just now dead, a new murder. By whose hand?  Your sinister words give a prophecy of wonder! She did it by her own hand, and no other’s. Ah, no!  Before she died by mine as she deserved! Even your rage would be deflected, if you would learn the whole of it. Your tale begins strangely, but tell me what you mean. The sum is this:  she did wrong, but with a good intent. Did she do a good deed, corrupt traitor, when she killed your father? No, her plan was to apply a love-charm for your heart, when she saw your new marriage inside the house, but she missed her aim. And what Trachinian is so potent a charmer? Nessus the Centaur persuaded her long ago to inflame your desire with such a potion. Ah!  Ah, misery!  I am lost, ruined, ruined!  The light of day exists for me no more! Ah, now I understand the depth of my misfortune!  Go, my son!  Your father is no more.  Summon for me all the crop of your brothers.  Summon, too, poor Alcmena, in vain the bedfellow of Zeus, so that you may hear my final words tell what oracles I know. I cannot.  Your mother is not here.  It happens that she keeps her home at But we who are with you, Father, will render at your command all service that is needed. Hear, then, your task.  You have come to where you will reveal what sort of man you are, who are called my son. perish by no creature that had the breath of life, but by one already dead, a dweller with Hades.  So this savage Centaur in death has killed me alive, just as the divine will had been foretold.  And I will show you how later oracles tally with the first and testify to the old prophecy.  I wrote them down for myself from the mouth of my father’s oak of many tongues in the grove of the Selli, who dwell on the hills and sleep on the ground.  The tree said that, at the time which lives and now is, my release from the toils laid upon me would be accomplished.  And I expected prosperous days, but the meaning, it seems, was only that I would die.  For toil comes no more to the dead.  Since, then, my son, those words are clearly finding their fulfillment, you, on your part, must fight on my behalf.  You must not delay, and so sharpen my tongue, but give your consent to work with me, like one who has discovered that best of laws, the law of obedience to your father. Yes, Father—though in coming to this point in our talk I begin to have some fear—I will obey you in all your decrees. First of all, put your right hand in mine. With what purpose in mind do you so strongly urge this pledge on me? Give your hand at once—do not disobey me! Here, I hold it out to you.  Nothing will be denied you. Now, swear by the head of Zeus my begetter! To do what deed?  May this also be revealed? To perform for me the task that I shall impose. I swear it with Zeus for witness of the oath. And pray that, if you break this oath, you may suffer. I shall not suffer, since I will keep it.  Yet so I pray. Good, then do you know the summit of Oeta, Zeus’s sacred mountain? I know it.  I have often stood on that height to sacrifice. Then, you must carry my body there after raising it up in your own hands, aided by as many of our friends as you require; and when you have cut many a branch from the deep-rooted oak and chopped down many a sturdy wild-olive, you must lay my body on them and with a flaming pine-torch burn it. No, do this without laments or tears, if you are indeed my son. But if you fail to do this, even from the world below my curse and my wrath shall await you for ever. Ah, Father, what have you said?  What you have done to me! I have spoken that which you must perform.  If you refuse, then get yourself some other father, and be called my son no longer! Ah, me!  What deeds you call on me to do, Father—that I should become your murderer, polluted with your blood! Not so, in truth, but healer of my sufferings, sole physician of my pain! And how, by inflaming your body, shall I heal it? If your fear keeps you from this one task, at least perform the rest. The service of carrying you will not be refused. And the heaping of the pyre which I have ordered? Yes, except that I will not touch fire to it with my own hands. All else will I do, and you will have no hindrance on my part. Well, that much will be enough—yet add one small favor to your large benefits. Even if it is tremendously large, it will be done. Do you know, then, the maiden, daughter of Eurytus? You mean Iole, I would guess. You know her.  Just this is the command that I impose upon you, my son:  when I am dead, if you wish to show your piety by remembrance of your oath to your father, make this woman your wife and do not disobey your father. Let no other but you take her who has lain close at my side.  You, my son, make that marriage-bond your own.  Obey;  for although you were obedient in great affairs, your disobedience in small ones cancels the gratitude already won. Ah, me, it is wrong to be angry with a sick man, but who could bear to see him have thoughts like these? Your words show no willingness to do as I say. Who on earth would, when she alone is to blame for my mother’s death, and for your present condition besides? Who would choose to do so, unless he were infected by avenging fiends?  It would be better, Father, that I also die, rather than live united with those whom I most detest! The man will render no due respect, it seems, to my dying prayer.  No, be sure that the curse of the gods will await you for disobeying my commands. Ah, you will soon show, it seems, how diseased you are! Yes, for you stir me from my slumbering plague. I am miserable!  I have no way out of so many dilemmas! Yes, since you think it wrong to obey your begetter. But must I then learn to be unholy, Father? It is not unholy, if you gladden my heart. Do you, then, command me to do this as a clear duty? I do, and I call on the gods to bear me witness! Then I will do it, and not refuse, —calling upon the gods to witness your deed.  I can never be condemned for obeying you, Father. Your words make a fair ending, and to them, my son, quickly add the gracious deed itself, so that you may place me on the pyre before any pain returns to tear or sting me. Come, make haste and lift me!  This, in truth, is rest from troubles, this is the end, the last end, of Heracles! Nothing hinders the fulfillment of your wish, since your commandment strongly compels me, Father. Come, then, before you awaken this plague, O my hardened soul, give me a bit of steel to bind my lips like stone to stone!  Stop any cry, since the task you accomplish, though by constraint, gives cause for joy. Lift him, attendants! Grant me ample forgiveness for this, but also recall the great cruelty of the gods in the deeds that are being done.  They beget children and are hailed as fathers, and yet they can let such sufferings pass before their eyes. No man foresees the future;  the present is full of mourning for us, and of shame for the powers above, and indeed of hardship beyond compare for him who endures this disaster. And you, maiden, do not be left at the house.  You have seen immense, shocking death, with sorrows great in number and strange.  And in all of them there is nothing that is not Zeus.  \n"
